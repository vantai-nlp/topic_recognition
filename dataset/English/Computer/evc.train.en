The CMS programming interface is a way for you to get CMS to do work for you.
It is made up of:
You can use them in System/370 mode only.
They should not be used by programs other than CMS.
This format is language dependent.
This return code variable must be the second parameter in the list, and it must be a signed integer variable with a length of 4.
A length may also be associated with a parameter if it is a character string that can vary in length.
Character strings can be specified in lowercase, mixed case, or uppercase.
For signed integer parameters, the length is always 4.
Therefore, a length parameter, which is an integer field, must follow where indicated.
You must specify all preceding optional parameters.
This is a character string that contains up to 8 characters for file name followed by up to 8 characters for file type.
There must be at least one blank between the file name and the file type.
This character string may be in mixed case.
This is a character string defined as follows:
Specifying only a period (.)
The file pool name can be up to 8 characters long.
The first character must be alphabetic, but the remaining characters can be alphabetic or numeric.
The user ID can be up to 8 characters long.
Lower case is converted to uppercase.
If specified by itself, it means the user's top directory in the default file pool.
Subdirectory names can be up to 16 characters long.
The first character must be alphabetic, but the remainder can be alphabetic or numeric.
It is an 8-byte character variable used to identify an instance of an open file or directory.
This is a signed integer variable with a length of 4.
It is a 4-byte integer field.
This is a character variable with a length of 6.
If it is specified, it must be followed by a length field.
See the associated reason code.
Depending on the program function and the error condition, file pool object can refer to any of the above objects.
Errors can cause return code 8 or 12.
Refer to topic 2.2 for examples of call formats.
Is open (for read or write)
Up to 10 input character strings are allowed on a call.
(See Usage Note 3.)
If the buffer is too long, the unused part of the buffer is unchanged.
These variables are then available to the application program.
(This return code is issued from EXEC2 only.)
When all the variables have been retrieved, a return code of 206 is set.
The date attribute is the date that the file was last modified.
The time attribute is the time at which the file was last modified.
This request was ignored Note:
The value of length5 must not be greater than 80.
If user1 needs to share user2's file, user2 can grant user1 read or write authority on the file.
System error.
Any number of users can access a file control directory in read/write status.
These users can write to different files within the directory at the same time.
Any number of users can access file control directories in read-only status.
In particular, when a user has a directory control directory accessed in read/write mode, no other user can write to the directory.
This requires that you do not have the containing directory accessed read-only and that no other user has it accessed read/write.
Only one user can have the update lock at a time.
Your system administrator can tell you if the batch facility you are using is set up that way.
If it is, the batch machine runs your job under your user ID.
Error means the request failed.
Errors cause return code 8.
If you have the directory accessed, it will be released.
When the attribute is changed, any user who has the directory accessed will have it released automatically with no message issued.
A directory can be erased only by the directory owner or the administrator.
You can also erase files in a directory that is open.
This means that the result is the same as for recoverable files.
For REPLACE, this field is passed in by the user and contains the data type of the data being replaced.
For REPLACE, this field will be passed in by the user with the length, in bytes, of the replacement data.
Characters 4 through 8 are unused but must contain 0 or 1.
The keyword must be either AND or OR.
The actual data is received in the buffer parameter.
Buffer will contain the character data.
Buffer will contain the replacement character data.
An example of this is the size of your virtual storage, which is a single value.
Make sure that your actual buffer is at least this long.
The value passed in the first character of buffer was not a character 0 or 1.
Only one of these characters can be set to 1 at a time.
This is an invalid combination.
Check the explanation of each parameter to determine what the correct data type should be.
Check the explanation of each parameter to determine what the correct length should be.
When the directory is accessed, this variable indicates whether the directory is accessed in read/write status.
Or, if the directory is accessed, it is accessed in read-only status.
It is a character variable between 0 and 6.
If not specified and the file is found, the return code is 0.
F indicates that all the records in the file have the same length.
V indicates that the records in the file may have different lengths.
It is a character value between '0' and '6'
If an entire group cannot fit in the buffer, it does not return that group or any of the remaining fields of the record.
This is a character value between 0 and 6.
When REPLACE is specified, the attributes of the source file (for example, record format and logical record length) and the authorities of the target file are kept.
(This parameter is ignored for existing target files.)
Yes means the user can copy a file under the specified lock and No means he cannot.
Immediately after Open Directory, Get Directory starts with the directory that was opened.
Then, if there are subdirectories to that directory, their entries are retrieved, and so on down the directory structure.
D indicates that this is a directory.
Multiple calls to Get Directory - File may be used.
Immediately after Open Directory, Get Directory starts with the first directory entry.
Authority for the subdirectory is not provided by this function.
D indicates that this is a directory record.
A file-not-found error condition can occur even though the Open Directory indicated that the file does exist.
For performance, a question mark.
Multiple calls to Get Directory may be used.
The number of records must be greater than zero.
(It does not return partial records.)
The buffer formats for the various types of directory records are as follows:
When status=3, this field will always be blank because the base file no longer exists.
Immediately after an Open Directory, Get Directory starts with the first directory entry.
This is the maximum amount of data that can be received.
The input value on a first call must be zero in order to start at the first error block for this work unit.
Your application must not change this value on subsequent calls.
Your application can use this field to identify the resource type for the resource that had an error.
Your application should set the following length2 field to 8 so that a maximum size exit name will fit in the output field.
READ authority on a file lets the user read the contents of a file.
READ authority on a directory lets the user read the directory contents, which consists of the names of all files and subdirectories.
It means a user can read, modify, or erase a file.
It does not give authorization to read or write any of the files in that directory.
Multiple user IDs may be specified, separated by blanks.
Because the users are not at the current release level, however, they cannot determine that they have these authorities.
Length Description 0-8 the SNA network ID 0-1 a delimiter (a period) 1-8 the LU name If both the network ID and the LU name are present, they are separated by a period.
Only files with this file mode number will be passed on a later Get Directory.
This read-only status has no effect on file control directories, but does affect the use of directory control directories (see the Usage Notes)
This read/write status has no effect on file control directories, but does affect the directory control directories (see the Usage Notes)
For best performance, use FILE unless you need the extended attributes.
You must have authority on the file name specified.
If special characters (* or\%{}) are specified, you must also have authority on the directory.
The last three fields will be blank if you are not authorized for the directory.
This means that while a directory is open, changes to information in the directory may or may not be reflected in subsequent Get Directory requests.
When a directory is open, 16KB of data is sent to the user's virtual machine for use by Get Directory.
If changes are made while the directory is open, (for example, a file is erased) those changes are not reflected in the data in the user machine.
In this case, changes are immediately reflected and subsequent Get Directory requests reflect those changes.
If you own the directory, for example, CMS will try to establish a read/write status for you.
It has no files or subdirectories Note:
The default, if not specified, is 1.
The file is created and can now be written to and read from.
If the file does not exist, a new file is created.
All changed and added records will be written.
If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.
Specifying this parameter causes the file system to cache multiple data blocks for the file, performing I/O only when the cache buffer is full.
If not specified, the default is fixed (F)
It is the date the file was last read or modified.
If a file is opened for REPLACE, a read before a write gives an end-of-file return code.
If you choose the READ option and a file or directory is locked, the open is allowed.
However, if they are specified and they do not match those already in the file, a warning is generated.
Some error data was lost Note:
The top default work unit ID in the stack is removed, and the previous default becomes the active default.
If in CMS mode, this is work unit ID 1.
This must be a single character digit from '0' through '6'
This work unit ID will be used whenever a work unit ID is not specified.
The length of buffer must be 153 bytes.
File system administrator authority is required to specify another user's user ID.
File pool administrator authority is required to specify this parameter for another user's user ID.
For a file containing variable-length records, this must be a 1.
For a file with variable-length records, this parameter specifies the length of the record to be read.
For a file with fixed-length records, this parameter must be equal to the product of the records parameter and the logical record length.
Variable-length records can be up to 65,535 bytes long are supported by CMS.
They are only read one at a time.
When reading variable-length records, a record that is longer than the buffer length is truncated.
File is not open Note:
All subdirectories and files will be moved.
This parameter can only be specified for a file control directory or a file within a file control directory.
For files within file control directories:
When you specify an authority option, only the indicated authority is changed.
If no name is provided, records are formatted in the standard hexadecimal dump format.
The file or directory specified does not have to exist in the file pool.
CMS does check to ensure that the name is valid (contains only valid characters, for example)
For a file containing variable-length records this must be a 1.
For a new file, writing begins with record 1 unless specified otherwise with the position parameter.
Variable-length records can be up to 65,535 bytes long.
All data has been updated in place.
As many as would fit in the user-supplied area on a previous call were filled in.
Any display of this value should be hexadecimal.
The column descriptions are as follows:

Operating Environment of CPI Communications Program 2.3 3.
Character Sets 01134 and 00640 A.2 7.
This book contains no programming interfaces for customer use.
This chapter describes the major terms and concepts used in CPI Communications.
Figure 1 illustrates the logical view of an example SNA network.
The network shown in Figure 1 is a simple one.
For example, if Program A is being discussed, Program A is the local program and Program C is the remote program.
Some restrictions may apply in this situation, since CPI Communications does not support all LU 6.2 functions.
In Figure 2, two lines are connected to the bottom of the Program A block.
The new line on the left shows Program A's communication with the communications element itself.
The different types of CPI Communications calls that a program may make are discussed later in this chapter in "Program Calls."
CPI Communications provides a way to use system-defined values for these required fields; these system-defined values are called side information.
(Refer to specific product information for details.)
CPI Communications programs communicate with each other by making program calls.
It indicates whether a call completed successfully or if some error was detected that caused the call to fail.
CPI Communications uses additional output parameters on some calls to pass status information to the program.
Table 2 lists the two groups of CPI Communications calls.
In the previous example, the programs used the initial set of program characteristics provided by CPI Communications as defaults.
In all cases, the value used for the three remains the same.
This information is provided in Table 7 in topic A.3.2.
While in this wait state, the program is unable to perform other processing.
(Program C completes. normally)
The steps shown in Figure 5 are:
(Further processing by both programs)
The other calls are discussed in the following examples.
The steps shown in Figure 10 are:
The steps in Figure 11 are described below: (further processing by both programs) Figure 11.
For each call, this chapter provides the function of the call and any optional setup calls, which can be issued before the call being described.
The actual syntax used to program the calls in this chapter depends on the programming language used.
Usage Notes Additional information that applies to the call.
Related Information Where to find additional information related to the call.
An example of that format is provided below:
Programming language considerations that apply only to a certain environment are not listed in this section, but they are included in the appendix that describes that environment.
Each argument in the parameter list must be called (listed) by name.
Each variable in the parameter list must be level 01.
"Call Syntax" in topic 4.1 shows the syntax for the programming language being used.
The program can use this call for various application-level functions.
The local program (which issued the Receive call) can now send data.
Only a portion of the logical record is available because it has been truncated.
The data consists of logical records.
The length of the data field can range from 0 to 32765 bytes.
Therefore, logical record length values of X'0000', X'0001', X'8000', and X'8001' are not valid.
If the data field length is zero, the complete logical record contains only the 2-byte length field.
Further action is defined by program logic.
No state change occurs when the call is issued in Send state.
The record has been truncated.
This indicates that an error at the remote program occurred in the data before the remote program received send control.
The length can be from zero to eight bytes.
CPI Communications makes use of two variable types, integer and character string.
Table 7 in topic A.3.2 defines the type and length of variables used in this document.
Variable types are described below.
No further restrictions beyond those described above are intended.
The character-string length represents the number of characters a character string can contain.
For some character strings, the minimum specification length is zero.
All products can send or receive the maximum specification length for the character string.
Space characters, if present, are not part of the character string.
The period is not part of the network ID or the network LU name.
These include all g characters allowed as an OS/2 file name.
Some of the return codes indicate the results of the local processing of a call.
CPI Communications does not support these parameters.
The source of the error is considered to be inside the program definition (under the control of the local program)
This return code may be caused by the failure of the program to pass a valid parameter address.
The CPI Communications state table shows when and where different CPI Communications calls can be issued.
As described in "Program Flow --
The following symbols are used in the state table to indicate the condition that results when a call is issued from a certain state:
(LU 6.2 is also known as Advanced Program-to-Program Communications or APPC.)
Although much of the LU 6.2 function has been included in CPI Communications, some of the function has not.
These features are differences in syntax.
CPI Communications does not support the following functions that are available with the LU 6.2 interface:
Not listed above are the LU 6.2 security parameters.
This indicates that the error at the remote program occurred in the data, before (in LU 6.2 terms) the change-direction indicator was received.
This indicates that the error at the remote program occurred in the send processing after the change-direction indicator was received.
Programs written using CPI Communications can communicate with APPC programs.
APPC programs with names containing characters no longer allowed may require a name change.
D This parameter has been set to a default value by the CPI Communications call.
Default values can be found in the individual call descriptions.
S This parameter can be set using the CPI Communications call.
It must therefore be specified.
If the entry does exist, all of its parameters are replaced.
The format of the structure is shown in Table 19.
The null string (all space characters) is a valid mode name.
The key within the variable may be from 1 to 8 characters long.
This is a required parameter.
The device is determined by the system.
The local location name is determined by the system.
Specify the name of the local location.
The mode specified in the system network attributes is used.
Specify the mode name for the remote location.
The remote network ID for the remote location is used.
The remote network has no name.
Specify a remote network ID.
A device with a status of active is selected (if available)
These are explained in this and the following sections.
RPG is not supported in this environment.
If this fails, contact the system administrator.
Follow the same steps as for return code -07.
Follow the same step as for return code -10.
Specific notes for each of these languages are listed in the individual sections that follow.
Follow this example to prepare the program:
The resource name is passed to the application as a parameter.
This return code variable must be a signed, 4-byte binary integer.
Length Description 0-8 the network ID 0-1 a delimiter (a period) 1-8 LU name If both the network ID and the LU name are present, they are separated by a period.
Allow 17 bytes for this variable: 0 to 8 bytes for a network ID, 1 to 8 bytes for the LU name, and 1 byte for a delimiter if both a network ID and LU name are specified (this is a period)
This variable must be an 8-byte character string.
Allow 64 bytes for this variable.
This must be a 4-byte binary integer value from 0 to 8.
The access security information, if present, consists of either a user ID or a user ID and password.
This variable must be a 4-byte signed integer with a value from 0 to 8.
It must be a character string variable 8 bytes in length.
It must be a 4-byte signed binary integer.
This information will not be available after it has been presented to the program.
This information is placed in the console input buffer.
It will not be available after it has been presented to the program.
On console input events, the contents of the console input buffer are stored here.
This must be a character string variable with a length of 130 bytes.
If more than 130 bytes were supplied, the data is truncated and the application will get only the first 130 bytes.
Unable to get storage - A storage failure prevented the resource manager program from being identified.
The application will no longer receive requests for this resource.
The actions taken for this event are application-specific.
A program should set the appropriate variables equal to the appropriate values, and then use those variables as parameters on CPI Communications calls.
See the appropriate product appendix for the names and locations of these files in a particular operating environment.
This working storage definition defines the variables to be used with the communications CPI calls.

This should reflect what is already installed plus any hardware you plan to install or remove during the conversion time period.
This should include any changes you have made to code provided by IBM.
The service machine will then record the number of times an application is called.

This is the case with the user directory.
Maintain the data on one system only and give two user IDs to users who need to access the data.
This is shown in Figure 11.
If you do this, you will have to manually update the directories to ensure that changes made to one directory are reflected in the other.
Then, if you need to back off, you can easily do so.
If you are using two source directories, you must remember to reflect changes made in one directory to the other directory.
If the stand-alone dump utility is on tape, you should know where the tape is.
Now assume that you have 110000 spool file records in your system.

A summary of differences follows.
In addition, there are many new or changed files.
There is a new recommended procedure for how to apply service.
This file contains the following:
Control information, such as the name of the main and auxiliary control files to be used and the verification functions to be performed while service is applied.
The apply list is a list of the program temporary fixes (PTFs) that are to be applied to the component.
The result tells you how many pages the program needs (in hexadecimal)
In the example shown, 2128 is X'850'
The ending page is X'8DF' (X'850' plus X'8F' pages)
If present, all the 64K segments listed are to be shared by users.
This will be discussed below.
This is what you indicate on the TYPE parameter.
In the example, notice that the CHANGE command has a TYPE=S version and a TYPE=G version.

Note that at this point there should be no end users who will log on the system.
You may need to have application programmers log on to the system to test these applications.
You can begin with a representative sample of applications.
Figure 18 is a diagram showing the example.
As a result, a virtual machine user who is connected to the first system can log on to the second system.
The user finds a terminal with a local VM logo.
For instance, the 1403 printer has the default image library IMAG1403 and the 4248 has IMAG4248.
The command displays system-wide information in its own block.
The operator now has the same command set to operate all spooling printers.
For example, the 1403 has a default image library called IMAG1403.
For example, the response you get when the logical connection is made is:
When MVS was loaded (IPL), the resulting virtual machine reset also reset the terminal console mode to the value in the directory (3270)
Define 3262, 4245, and 4248 devices.
Programs that operate on SPOOL files owned by another user must now refer to SPOOL files by user ID and spool ID.
The actual contents of the message are not checked.
It also assumes the text begins at the location following the first blank.

This section provides you with some basic information about operating PC Support.
When you enter a command you should keep in mind the following optional PC parameters:
The drive and path information is necessary only if the command you are entering is not in the default directory or drive, or is in a search path you specified.
/X specifies which display mode to use.
If this value is entered in a command, it overrides the value specified in the display (DSPL) identifier in the configuration file for that command only.
If you want to change the value for all commands, use the PC Support editor to change the DSPL identifier.
For information about the PC Support editor, see Appendix D, "Configuring PC Support Using the Editor."
If the speed parameter is not specified, high speed display writing is used with all graphic adapters except the Color Graphics adapter.
If this value is entered, it overrides the value specified in the DSPL identifier in the configuration file for that command only.
/Z specifies that the IBM logo is not displayed.
End the work station function and message function.
When you have done this, press F3 to exit the PC Support menu.
Then, type the following after the DOS prompt:
STOPRTR Press the Enter key.
You can force all communications to end by entering the STOPRTR command with the/F parameter.
Enter the following command from the DOS prompt:
This information can be folders, documents, or files.
This means that the user is limited to selecting only the options shown on the assigned menu and any related displays.
The user cannot enter commands and procedures to control or start other jobs.
Therefore, it should be changed immediately to Level 30 security.
Level 20 indicates password security where a password and user ID are necessary, but all users have ALLOBJ authority.
A password is required to sign on the system.
Security level 40 is recommended after your system has run at security level 30 or below.
The level of security is controlled by the system value QSECURITY, which can be changed only by users with security officer authority.
Some software installation and maintenance procedures may automatically reduce the security level to 10.
If an incorrect entry was made for either the user identification or password, the router requests the information again.
This continues until a correct entry is made or until you choose to exit.
If you exit, you do not have a connection to that system.
Enter a user identification and password when requested for it by the router.
Any active sessions remain active.
The new user identification and password are only used for new sessions.
You can operate PC Support using the default values supplied by the product.
This chapter provides you with the basic information you need to use the configuration program.
To make changes in the way the work station function operates, you should use the work station function configuration program.
You do not have to edit the files yourself.
The batch file should run normally the next time it is processed.
Select option 1 (PC Support Configuration) from the displayed window.
When you enter the command, the IBM logo is shown.
Working set At the top of the menu, is a list of the configuration and command (or batch) files that are updated when you make changes using the configuration program.
The list of files is referred to as your working set.
Before selecting any functions to configure, make sure the working set indicates the correct drive, directory, and file names.
Functions In the center of the menu is a list of the functions you can select to change with the configuration program.
Function keys At the bottom of the menu is a group of function keys.
The working set displayed by the PC Support configuration program is the list of items which define your PC Support configuration.
The working set consists of the drive, the PCS directory, and file names that the program uses to display or change your configuration.
By changing the drive and the file names, you change the way PC Support operates.
The configuration file specified in your working set determines how the PC Support functions operate.
The configuration program displays the current values in the configuration file when you select a function to configure.
The command file specified in your working set is the batch file used to start PC Support.
It contains the commands that start each of the selected PC Support functions.
The PC Support subdirectory is the subdirectory containing your PC Support files.
Though you cannot change the subdirectory, you can change the drive on which the PCS subdirectory is stored.
The default drive for the PCS subdirectory is drive C.
You can set up different methods of operation by specifying alternative configuration and command files.
If you want to use alternative files, you must specify them before you select a function to work with.
Press F7 (Change working set)
Type the drive, path, and file name to specify a new configuration file or command file.
Type the drive to specify where the PCS subdirectory is stored.
Now, go on to select and configure a function.
Save your changes as you exit to update the configuration files.
F7 (Change working set) Use this key to change your working set of configuration and command files.
When you press F7, the Working Set window is shown.
You can change your working set by typing the name of a new configuration file, a new command file, or a new drive on which the PCS subdirectory is stored.
F9 (Additional options) Use this key to start the PC Support editor.
The PC Support editor helps you work directly with the identifier entries in a configuration file.
The editor displays the entries in a specified file and provides prompts for adding, changing, or deleting the entries in the file.
By changing the entries, you can change the way PC Support operates.
To start the editor, press F9 and select the PC Support editor option from the Additional Options window.
Select option 1 (Exit configuration)
The environment you have defined is created on your personal computer the next time you use the PC Support function.
You may need to start your personal computer again for your changes to take effect.
When you use the shared folders function, you assign one of eight drive letters supplied by the shared folders function to the folder or system of folders you want to use.
Therefore, you can use many of the DOS commands to work with the folders.
The program can use the data in the memory cache again and again.
It is possible for two files to use the memory cache at the same time.
In other words, when you increase the size of your memory cache, you reduce the memory available for other operations.
You may want to use one of the following methods to determine the appropriate size of your memory cache.
Start with a memory cache of approximately 13K.
From there, vary the size of the cache depending on how your PC applications fit into the remaining memory.
Determine the average size of your read and write operations.
Once you have determined the size, you can use the PC Support configuration program to change it.
You can use any of the shared folders function types if you meet the requirements for the type.
It is not necessary for you to add these entries.
The following list should help you determine the type you are currently using.
Use the PC Support configuration program to change the type of shared folders function you are using.
The values for nn can vary from 0 to 34.
Type 0 requires less memory than the other types, but may not perform as well.
As a result, its performance is better.
However, it does require more personal computer memory to run than type 0.
It is not necessary for you to add this statement to the file.
The shared folders function type 2 program contains all of the features of the type 1 memory cache.
However, type 2 uses more PC memory than type 1.
It is done automatically for you by the installation program if you install the Release 2.0 or the Release 3.0 PC Support program, or by the configuration program if you change your shared folders function type to type 2.
This also starts an interactive program you can use to assign or release a drive.
The configuration program automatically changes the information in your configuration and batch files so the next time you start PC Support the new shared folders function type is started.
Use the PC Support configuration program to select shared folders function type 0.
Refer to Chapter 2, "Configuring PC Support with the Configuration Program" for information on displaying this menu.
Verify that the files shown for your working set are the files you want changed.
Select the Shared folders function option from the list of functions on the menu.
Press F10 (Actions) and select Work with type from the list of actions.
This is the drive from which you start your personal computer.
Press F3 (Exit)
Select option 1 (Save and Exit) from the window.
Press F3 (Exit) and select option 1 (Exit configuration) from the window shown.
Stop PC Support if it is running, and then start your personal computer again.
You can use the configuration program to select shared folders function types 1 or 2.
The default value is 14.
Select a number from 2 to 32.
Select a number from 3 to 640.
If you want a drive and folder assigned the same way each time you start PC Support, use the configuration program to define the drive.
Then each time you start PC Support, the drive letter is assigned to its corresponding folder or folders.
Press F10 (Actions) and select Change from the list of actions.
Select option 2 (Add drive definition) from the displayed window.
Enter values for the prompts that are displayed in the window.
Select the drive letter you want to assign.
Your personal computer may be attached to more than one system.
You do not need to specify a system name.
If you do not, the default system name is used.
You can assign a PC drive letter as a system drive or as a folder drive.
If you assign it as a system drive, you can use any folder you have authority to on the specified system.
If you assign it as a folder drive, you can use the folder you specified.
To assign the drive letter as a system drive, leave this prompt blank.
To assign it as a folder drive, enter the name of the folder.
Press the Enter key when you have finished.
Select option 1 (Save and Exit)
Press F3 (Exit) and select option 1 (Exit configuration) from the displayed window.
Stop PC Support if it is running and then start your personal computer again.
You can use the configuration program to define a drive so a folder is assigned the same way each time you start PC Support.
You can use the configuration program to change the current drive definition.
These changes include changing the drive assigned, the action performed on the drive, the system name, and the folder name.
If you have only defined one drive using the configuration program, an asterisk (*) is shown in front of option 4 (Move drive definition)
Use the Arrow keys or the Tab key to move to the prompt you want to change.
The following list describes the actions you can select: - Option 1 (Assign) if you want the drive assigned each time you start PC Support.
Option 2 (Release) if you want the drive released.
For example, you could set up your shared folders function configuration so a drive is assigned each time you start PC Support using your default configuration file.
Then you could set up a second configuration using an alternative configuration file that releases the same drive.
You would run the default configuration file to assign the drive and, when you are finished working with the drive, run the alternative configuration file to release the drive.
Press the Enter key when you have completed your changes.
Select option 1 (Save and exit) to save your changes and exit.
You may find it necessary to change the order in which your drives are assigned.
Select option 4 (Move drive definition)
The Move drive definition window is shown.
If you decide you do not want a previously defined drive assigned each time you start PC Support, you can use the configuration program to delete it.
When you delete a drive, you are removing it from your configuration file so it is not assigned the next time you start PC Support.
Press the Enter key to delete the drive.
For example, you could assign drive D to the folder DEPT24.
When you use a folder drive, you must have a separate drive assigned for each folder you want to use.
You do not have to end the application you are running to assign the drive to a different folder.
Your personal computer works with folders like it works with directories.
If you know you need the information stored in a specific folder, you can assign a drive to that folder so that you can easily use the information in it.
There are several ways to assign a folder drive.
If you want the drive assigned each time you start PC Support, use the configuration program to define the drive as a folder drive.
Once you have assigned a folder drive, you can use the folder by entering the drive letter after the DOS prompt.
For example, if you have drive F assigned to folder DEPT254, you would enter the following:
F:\BACKSLASH{}DEPT254 You can use most of the DOS commands to work with the drive and folder.
An alternative to using a folder drive is to use one system drive.
Then you can use drive F like you would use a folder drive.
Using a folder name as the path in the DOS file name.
There are some restrictions when using certain DOS commands like COPY and BACKUP.
Refer to your DOS manual for more information.
A folder, file, or document name can be 1 to 12 characters long, including an optional extension.
If no extension is included, the name has a maximum of 8 characters.
If an extension is included, the extension must start with a period and can have up to 3 additional characters.
See your DOS manual for more information about the DIR command.
When you use this mode, you are the only one who can access the file.
You are the only one who can access the file, but you can only access it once.
You cannot access it a second time from another drive while it is open.
Once you have started the shared folders function, you can * Check the status of a drive * Assign or release a drive * View help information about working with drives You can use the FSPC command to display the status of all assigned shared folders function drives.
To do so, enter the following command at the DOS prompt:
Use the FSPC command to assign or to release one drive.
You can use the commands from a command line or put them in a batch file.
You can use the FSPC command to assign or to release one folder at a time.
You can use the FSPC command from a command line or you can put one or more FSPC command statements in a batch file.
To assign a drive, enter the following command at the DOS prompt:
If you do not specify a drive letter, the next available drive is assigned.
To assign a drive to a folder, enter the following command after the DOS prompt:
If you want to assign a drive to a folder within a folder, enter the following:
FSPC Then follow the prompts on the displays to assign the drive.
If you plan to assign several folders at a time, a batch file makes the process easier.
If you use a batch file, you need one FSPC command statement for each drive you want assigned or released.
An error message is displayed.
You can use the FSPC command to release a drive or to release all of the drives currently assigned.
The FSPC command only allows you to assign or to release a single drive with one command.
You can do this using the configuration program or the PC Support editor.
The entry in the configuration file would look like this:
You can use the FSPC command to view help information that will assist you while working with folders.
To view general help information about working with folders, enter the following after the DOS prompt:
Use this as your cache size.
The subsystem is used only when you are using shared folders function type 2.
It shared its memory pool with several other programs.
If you are using shared folders function type 2, you will use this subsystem.
The subsystem is supplied with its own default values for the size of the memory pool and the activity level of the subsystem.
You can use the default values supplied or you can change them.
The command should be entered as follows:
Then you must enter it again.
You can use the default values or you can change them to meet your own needs.
For more information about subsystems and the CL commands you can use with them, see the DDS Reference.
For each object, you can determine specific authority or public authority.
Specific authority describes the authority for individual users.
Resource security is stored with each object.
You can assign resource security in different ways: - Specify the public and specific authority for a folder.
Then, let the objects within the folder use the same authority.
If you need to add or delete a name from the group, you make the change in the authorization list.
Use a group profile to specify the same kind of authority to a group of users.
When you give specific authority for an object to the name of a group profile, every member of the group has the same authority for the object.
Special authority security, this type of security overrides any specific or public authority given to an object.
Special authority is specified in your user profile.
Working for another user This type of authority allows a user to work with the mail and folders of another user.
When you have authority to work for another user, you have all the authority of that user.
To remove the device driver from memory, use the remove PC Support function.
You cannot remove shared folders function type 0 from memory.
For more information about removing PC Support from memory, refer to PC Support User's Guide for DOS.
Before you can use a host system printer as a virtual printer you need to assign it.
You can define up to three printers to be used from your personal computer.
These printers can all be local personal computer printers, virtual printers, or any combination of the two.
All three printers can be active at the same time.
If you want to use a virtual printer the same way each time you start PC Support, you can use the PC Support configuration program to set up the printer.
When you use the PC Support configuration program, you define how you want the printer to operate.
To use this method, you must first start the PC Support configuration program.
Select the Virtual printer option from the list of functions on the menu.
The Virtual Printer Configuration menu is shown.
Select option 2 (Add printer definition) from the window.
Enter values for the parameters displayed in the Add printer definition window.
Use the Arrow keys or the Tab key to move through the parameters displayed in the window.
Press Enter when you have finished filling in the parameters.
At this point, the configuration has been changed.
The following list describes the parameters in the Add printer definition window.
If you do not specify a system name, the default system name is used.
You must select a printer device or a printer file or both.
If you select a library, you must also select a printer file.
If you select a printer file but do not select a library, the host system searches through your library list to find the printer file.
If you specify a printer device in addition to a printer file, the virtual printer function will change any values supplied by the printer file that are not valid for the printer device you choose.
Press the Tab key to see additional prompts.
You may want to provide values for the other parameters described below.
If you leave fields blank, default values are supplied when the virtual printer is assigned.
The Printer data type prompt tells the virtual printer how to handle the data from your personal computer.
For example, if you selected 6 lines per inch and your page is 11 inches long, your page length is 66 lines.
If you select a number less than your page length, the blank lines will be at the bottom of your printed page.
If your data is already formatted, you should use the same value as the page length value.
If you selected option 3 (final-form text) as your printer data type, you can enter any number from 1 through 99.
A default value of 10 seconds is supplied.
You can use the value supplied or specify one of your own.
If your set of data does not print all in one printout but is split up into smaller ones, the time-out value is too short.
Decrease the number of seconds, or wait longer after sending one set of data to be printed before you send the next.
If you select 0, your output file is not closed by the time-out parameter.
The host system printer starts printing your data as soon as it receives the first character, without waiting for the output file to close.
Choosing option 2 (No) can save your time if you are printing a large amount of data.
However, other users are not able to print their data until your output file is closed and completely printed.
When you have provided values for the parameters, press the Enter key to add the printer definition.
If you have used the configuration program to assign a virtual printer and decide you want to change the way it is set up, you can change it using the configuration program.
Press F10 (Actions) and select Change from the action bar.
Select option 1 (Change printer definition)
Press the Enter key when you have changed the appropriate prompts.
Press F10 (Actions) and select Exit.
Select option 1 (Save and Exit) to save the changes you have made and exit the Virtual Printer Configuration menu.
If you define a virtual printer using the configuration program and decide you no longer want it assigned each time you start PC Support, you can use the configuration program to delete it.
Use the Arrow keys or the Tab key to select the printer you want to delete.
Press the Enter key to select option 1 (Save and Exit)
Press F3 (Exit) and select option 1 (Exit configuration)
You can also change just the virtual printer ASCII-to-EBCDIC translation table.
If you have no virtual printers currently assigned, it can be used to assign one.
It can also be used to change a virtual printer assigned by the automatic virtual printer program.
Virtual printers assigned using the SETVPRT program remain assigned until you release them, PC Support is stopped, or you turn off your personal computer.
If you want the virtual printer assigned each time you start PC Support, use the PC Support configuration program to define the printer.
Refer to "Configuring a Printer with the Configuration Program" in topic 4.2 for information about using the PC Support configuration program.
The interactive virtual printer program, SETVPRT, provides the prompts you need to assign or change any virtual printers.
Use the SETVPRT command.
To use the SETVPRT command, enter the following after the DOS prompt:
The drive is required only if the SETVPRT program is not in the current drive.
The Current Virtual Printers display shows how the printers, if any, are currently assigned.
To use the Assign, Release, Close, or Exit actions of the virtual printer function, you must press F10 (Actions) and select an option from the action list.
The Release action is only displayed if there is a printer to release.
The Close action is only displayed if there are output files to close.
Your Current Virtual Printers display may look similar to the following:
Select the option Assign from the action list.
Enter values or select options for the prompts on the display.
Press the Enter key to assign the virtual printer or to have your changes go into effect.
If any problems are found, an error message is shown.
Press the Esc key to return to the Current Virtual Printers display.
The Current Virtual Printers display shows the values you selected for your virtual printer.
If a virtual printer is currently assigned, the Release option is shown at the top of the Current Virtual Printers display.
There are some virtual printers you cannot select.
The asterisk indicates that, because the virtual printer was never assigned, you cannot release it.
If an open output file exists, the Close option is shown at the top of the Current Virtual Printers display.
The asterisk indicates that there are no output files to close for that virtual printer or the virtual printer is not assigned.
Once you have finished using the interactive virtual printer program, you should end it.
If you want to use the same virtual printer configuration every time you run a particular application, you can have your virtual printers automatically set up using the automatic virtual printer program, CFGVPRT.
If you need to change the configuration of your virtual printer frequently, you should add the alternative configuration file name to the CFGVPRT command.
Specifies the drive where the alternative configuration file is located.
The file name can be from 1 to 8 characters and can include a 3-character extension.
You can use as many PRNT identifiers as you want, however, the maximum number of virtual printers allowed is three.
If you specify an alternative configuration file, CFGVPRT searches only for PRNT identifiers in the alternative configuration file.
To release a virtual printer using the automatic virtual printer program, create a PRNT identifier in a configuration file.
Specify the name of the virtual printer you want to release as the only parameter for the PRNT entry.
When all entries are processed successfully, the error level is 0.
If an error occurs, but you choose to continue the operation, the error level is set to 10 (hexadecimal 0A)
If printer data type 2 is specified for the virtual printer, the virtual printer function assumes that the data to be printed is intended for the IBM Proprinter* or other compatible personal computer printers.
If it is not, a single personal computer application output file will become multiple host system printer spool files.
If you do so, your output files will close properly; otherwise, you must exit the Displaywrite program for your output files to close properly.
No data conversion is done by the virtual printer function.
If you print data that is not already formatted to produce page breaks, specifying a value for lines per page that is less than the value specified for page length.
If you are using Displaywrite 4 you should remove the following command from the DW4BAT command file:
You can use the remove PC Support function to end and remove the resident virtual printer function from memory.
To remove it from memory, enter the following command after the DOS prompt: where d: and path are the drive and directory containing the remove PC Support function.
You can define up to five sessions.
The purpose of a work station function printer session is different from the purpose of the PC Support virtual printer function.
The term active session refers to the session currently on the display.
If the work station function was chosen when PC Support was installed and the programs that run the work station function were not changed, you will have one display session and a 5250 keyboard style defined for you already.
The configuration program helps you tailor the work station function for your own use.
The information about each display, printer, or graphics session is stored in a session profile.
The information about each keyboard type is stored in a keyboard profile.
Session and keyboard profiles are, in turn, stored in master profiles.
The following diagram shows the relationship between these profiles.
Before you can start configuring the work station function, you must decide which options and their values need to be changed.
As you decide which options need to be changed, you can record your choice on the work sheet.
If you create several master profiles, you can change the way your display, keyboard, and printer operate by selecting different master profiles.
Select option 2 (Work station function configuration) from the options in the window.
The following display is shown.
Any work station function display session can be configured for graphics.
For information on memory requirements, refer to the PC Support Planning and Installation Guide for DOS.
To configure a session for graphics, specify that the session type is a display with graphics (see "Setting Up a Session Profile" in topic 5.4 for instructions)
Graphics defaults are provided for use in the graphics session.
However, you may want the graphics session to have different characteristics than those provided.
You can run CFGWSF to tailor the graphics session characteristics further.
Graphics plotter configuration is done with the configuration program, CFGWSF.
It lists the information you must provide about the plotter.
If you plan to use a graphics session, you should read the following sections.
These device drivers must be available for DOS at start time.
After you edit the files, you must start the operating system again before you can use or configure graphics.
If necessary, see the DOS manual for instructions on copying and editing files.
Select Create from the list of actions in the action bar.
Type the name of the master profile you want to create and press the Enter key.
You do not have to create names for the master profiles you want to use.
The work station function configuration program provides names for all profiles.
You can use the names provided or create your own.
When you press the Enter key, the Create Master Profile display is shown.
It provides the name of the master profiles you are working with as well as information about any sessions assigned to the master.
You can select to change your general options or your session information.
General Options are the options that affect all the display and printer sessions you run from one personal computer.
Select General Options from the action bar.
The following list provides the prompt names, their descriptions, and the values you can select for each.
Options Description Display Save Area Use this option to specify the size of the area in personal computer memory you want reserved for work station function.

Select the No option if you require additional personal computer memory for DOS and other applications.
The word Starting blinks as each session is started.
If you select this option, you do not need to press a key to continue (unless an error has occurred starting a session).
If you choose No, it is not.
The default for this option is No.
Consider using this option if you leave the display unattended, but do not want to stop sessions.
This option does not function in personal computer mode.
You can also change the keyboard style you use with this master profile.
(This is different from the keyboard type, which refers to the actual kind of keyboard attached to your personal computer.)
Use the Arrow keys to select the keyboard style you want to use.
The following list describes the options on this menu.
Functions and characters are placed in the same locations as found on the keyboard of a 5250 display station.
Functions and characters are placed on the keyboard where you define them.
When you have selected the keyboard style you want to use, press the Enter key.

By using the session manager program, you can display all of your work station function sessions in windows.
The following section describes the steps you should follow to configure the session manager program so the same window arrangement appears each time you start work station function and the session manager program.
Mark and copy information from any windowed session to any other windowed session including DOS.
Use a mouse if attached to the Personal System/2* or IBM Personal Computer.
In this case, the emulation cursor may or may not be present.
Use the 8514/A adapter support to display a full 132 columns of text.
A mouse is recommended when using the session manager.
The mouse driver should be installed and started before the 5250 session manager is started.
If the software support for the mouse is present, you cannot use the keyboard to control window functions.
Check the technical information about the mouse you want to ensure it supports this same interface.
The session manager program is a DOS resident program.
It does not affect the functions of the work station function.
For example, the session manager does not change any of the work station function keyboard, printer, or display definitions.
If you want the same window arrangement shown each time you start the session manager program, use the PC support configuration program to set up and save the windows.
You are not limited to the arrangement you configure.

You may work with the session or use the hot-key sequence to change to another work station function session.
Start the PC Support router by entering the following command:
Start work station function by entering the following command: where master profile, /S, and /T are as follows: master profile This is optional.
If it cannot find this file, the work station function uses the default configuration of a single display session with a PC keyboard style.
If you include a master profile, you can include a drive and a path to identify the profile location.
This function is provided to help the organizer start running without waiting for the operator to switch to the personal computer mode when the work station function is loaded.
To start a session stopped with STOPWSF.
You can start sessions again once the PC Support router is running again.
STARTWSF may only be used to start sessions that are currently stopped.
Do not put spaces between the comma.
The command has this format:
STARTWSF S, System name where:
The number you use may range from 1 to 5.
You must have already configured the session.
The following example shows two display sessions and one printer session.
If an error occurs while a session is starting, a message appears next to the session number.
When the session is successfully started, the status changes to Started (as shown).
Printer sessions start first followed by display sessions.
The hot-key sequence allows you to switch sessions within the work station mode and from the work station mode to the personal computer mode.
The default hot-key sequence is Alt+Esc.
STOPWSF has one required parameter, session number, and one optional parameter, force.
The command has the following format:
STOPWSF S /F where:
S Is the session number to stop.
This number may be in the range of 1 to 5.
If you intend to use work station function graphics, you must run this command each time you start the personal computer.
Be sure to run this command before you start work station function.
This program must be running in the DOS session before you can process graphics data.
This does not affect programs used by the work station function.
Using work station function graphics support every time you use work station function.
Therefore, the cursor appears when the work station function is waiting for the host system to provide more graphics data.
Cursor movement keys move the cursor when the type of display being shown allows it.
Switching sessions You can use the hot-key sequence at any time to switch sessions.
You can end WSF and use CFGWSF to increase the size of the VDI buffer.
The default size is the minimum, 20K bytes; 64K bytes is the maximum size.
Any size increase will be additional memory required by the work station function for the session.
If you have requested graphics from the host system, the data is processed even if you are in another session.
The work station function supports these same capabilities for graphics sessions or as many of these capabilities as the display you use allows.
The graphics display on a personal computer is not identical to the IBM 5292 graphics display.
The local select mode lets you use the keyboard for several functions while the display is in the graphics state.
The only local select function you can use for displays that are not in the graphics state is the function to change your text data into graphics.
To avoid this condition, use CFGWSF to make the buffer size larger than 20K bytes.
This is the only local select function you can use when the display is not in graphics state, but is showing text only.
The change has no effect until the next chart is requested from the host system.
During local select mode, any keys other than the correct local select keys cause a beep and are cleared.
To use a plotter with a graphics session, you must configure the display session type as host graphics support with a plotter attached.
You may configure any graphics display session for a plotter.
Work station function does not support any plotter that is not directly attached to the personal computer.
The graphics data stream generated by the host system uses an IEEE-488 protocol.
The work station function removes IEEE-488 protocol commands and sends the remaining data to the plotter by way of the interface.
The VDI commands are not used.
The work station function cannot support a plotter when both an asynchronous communications adapter and an SDLC or BSC adapter are used at the same time.
You must first set up a printer session using the work station function configuration program, CFGWSF.
For details, see "Setting Up a Session Profile" in topic 5.4.
You should not control your printer session from the operator panel on the printer.
You should control it from the printer operator panel displayed in your printer session.
Printer sessions use the same keyboard arrangement as display sessions.
To control printers from your printer panel display, select the option you want to use.
If the Ready indicator is on, you do not have to use this option.
To continue printing, you must use the Start option.
When you turn on the power again, you should use the Start option.
Be sure to use this option from the panel.
If you use the Line Feed switch on the printer during a printer session, the paper may no longer be aligned.
If you use the Form Feed switch on the printer, the paper may no longer be aligned.

Press Enter when you have finished.
The following describes the prompts on the menu.
If you want to use the hot-key sequence to exit a DOS session, you should select option 1 (Yes) for this prompt.
When you are finished running an application or command, you should exit from the DOS session rather than use the hot-key sequence.
If you want the text-assist function loaded in a work station function display session, you should select option 1 (Yes) for this prompt.
The text-assist function is loaded in the first work station function session in which the organizer has been started.
The enhanced text-assist function requires more PC memory, but contains additional functions you may find useful.
If you want to use the enhanced text-assist function, select option 1 (Yes) for this prompt.
A value of 0 specifies no time-out.
A value from 1 to 3600 seconds (1 hour) is allowed.
When there is not enough memory to start the selected text-assist functions.
When you are using DOS for another application.
When the text-assist function is already started in another work station function display session.
You can use the PC Support editor to change the way the organizer operates.
For information about using the PC Support editor, refer to Appendix D, "Configuring PC Support Using the Editor."
When you use command line parameters to change the organizer, the changes are not saved when you end the organizer function.
If DOS is currently in use, you cannot request Displaywrite 4 as your editor of choice.
You can merge information from one document with another.
You can also merge information between documents and from database files.
You must be using the work station function.
You must have the organizer and the text-assist function on the same drive and directory.
If you used the PC Support installation program to install PC Support, the following files are on the I drive:
You must be using the organizer.
Some column operations are not supported.
When you select option 3, the following display is shown:
When you use Displaywrite 4 or Displaywrite 4 Version 2 with the organizer, you may notice differences in printing.
You no longer have to change your document to final form before printing.
Otherwise, you print as you normally would using Displaywrite 4.
To do this, you need to use the personal computer keyboard profile that is provided with work station function.
This command prevents commands in a batch file from being displayed while the batch file is being processed.
Using an @ sign in front of commands.
After each DOS statement in the batch file, type:
If you start the organizer only in the pass-through display session, the organizer program remains active on your personal computer until you sign off the display.
If you start the organizer in the main display session, pass through to a second system, and then start the organizer from the pass-through display session, the organizer program is ended on your personal computer for both sessions when you sign off the pass-through display session.
You cannot run any programs in the main display session if the programs require the organizer.
Once you have installed PC Support and the programs required by the organizer and have configured your work station function sessions, you can change the options on the PC Support Organizer menu to meet your specific needs.
Sign off all work station function sessions.
For more information about using the PC Support organizer, see the PC Support User's Guide for DOS.
The PC Support transfer function is a set of programs that allows you to transfer data to or from the personal computer.
Before you can operate the transfer function, you must start PC Support.
You use the interactive programs when you are doing a one-time transfer request.
You also use the interactive programs to create or modify a transfer request to be used by the automatic transfer function programs.
You must have previously created and saved the transfer request using an interactive transfer program.
You are not asked for information; the transfer function uses the information supplied in the previously created transfer request.
You might want to use the automatic transfer programs when you often require the same information to be transferred.
That data could then be used by a personal computer application to create the report you need.
When the automatic transfer program runs, no prompts or displays appear; therefore, you cannot create or change a transfer request while the automatic transfer program is running.
You have the option of running the transfer function programs from your personal computer.
You can do this using the configuration program.
Press F10 (Actions) and select Copy options from the action bar.
Select option 1 (Copy files to PC).
This starts the copy process.
A file is a collection of records referred to by a single name.
The file description file identifies the format of the personal computer data file and describes the fields contained in the data file.
The data type, length, and number of decimal positions of each field are also described.
This information allows the transfer function to determine not only how the data should be changed, but also where a particular field exists in a file record.
See the DDM User's Guide for more information on using DDM files.
You can specify the data to be transferred and whether it is to be displayed, printed, or stored in a disk file on the personal computer.
To specify the conditions under which the records from files are combined, use the JOIN BY prompt.
To group records having a common value for a particular field, use the GROUP BY prompt.
To select fields to be transferred, use the SELECT prompt.
To remove records, use the WHERE prompt.
To remove groups of records, use the HAVING prompt.
To specify fields by which records are sorted, use the ORDER BY prompt.
All of the data in each record and all of the records in the file are transferred.
You must specify a System name if you are transferring data from a system other than the router default system.
Additional prompts allow you to specify how to display, print, or store the data on the personal computer.
Use the SELECT prompt to specify the fields you want to transfer.
Use the WHERE prompt to specify which records you want to transfer.
The WHERE prompt allows you to specify conditions that the information contained in the record must meet for the record to be transferred.
You specify the names of the fields by which the records are to be sorted.
After you create a transfer request, you can use the action list to modify, save, or run it.
Otherwise, the current transfer request is deleted.
Press F10 to go to the action list, select Create, and press the Enter key.
The create transfer request option list appears.
The input line is blank if the router is not active.
Place the cursor on the system name input line and press F4 to see a list of the possible system names.
Move the cursor to the system name you want and press the Enter key.
The name you selected is placed on the input line and the list is removed.
As you move the cursor from prompt to prompt on this display, one line of help frequently appears over the prompt line.
F4 (Prompt) can be used for all of the prompts on this display except for the Output device prompt.
FROM This prompt is required.
It identifies the name of the file or files where the data you want to transfer is stored.
The only name you have to specify is the file name.
Do not use a comma as a character in a file name.
If you do not specify the optional values, they are automatically supplied.
When the cursor is in the FROM input field, you can use F4 to get a list of libraries, files, members and formats.
This file contains the data that you want to transfer from the host system to your personal computer.
If you do not specify a library, then *LIBL is used.
A file name is required.
You must specify a member name or *FIRST as the member name before you can specify a record format name.
If a record format name is specified, it must be separated from the member name by a comma (, ).
If you do not specify a file member name, you cannot specify a record format name.
The library name, file name, file member name, and record format name each can have a maximum of 10 characters.
The library name, file name, and file member name must be all uppercase characters.
It identifies which fields in the record to transfer.
The fields you specify must be defined in the record format you previously specified in the FROM prompt.
If you want to transfer all the fields in the record, leave the asterisk (*) in the input field.
You can transfer up to 256 fields.
If there are more than 256 fields defined for the file, you cannot specify the asterisk.
You must specify the names of the fields you want to transfer.
(If you want to also transfer the sequence number field and the date field, you must specify the names of all the fields, including the data fields.)
You can specify the same field more than once if desired.
However, the maximum number of fields that you can select is 256.
You can press F4 to display a list of names.
If all the names of the fields do not fit on one SELECT prompt input area line, the transfer function automatically creates another line, or you can create another line by pressing the F9 key.
A field name cannot be split between two input area lines.
WHERE This prompt is optional.
It identifies which records are to be transferred.
A condition specifies a test against which the records in the file member are to be applied.
If you do not specify the WHERE prompt, all of the records in the specified file member are transferred.
The constant can be either a number or a character string enclosed in single quotes.
If a numeric field is specified for the field name, value must be the name of a numeric field, a numeric constant, or an expression.
Zeros are added where numbers are missing.
For more information on constants, expressions, and tests, refer to "Specifying Values in a Transfer Request" in topic 7.12.
ORDER BY This prompt is optional.
It identifies the order in which the records you request are to be sorted.
If you do not respond to the ORDER BY prompt, the records are transferred in no special order.
Records are sorted by the first field specified.
The names of fields specified in the ORDER BY prompt must also be specified in the SELECT prompt, or SELECT * must be specified.
The sum of the lengths of the fields specified must not be greater than 120.
If all the names of the fields do not fit on one line, the transfer function automatically creates another line, or you can create another line by pressing the F9 key.
After you complete the FROM, SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY prompts, you can continue to select the output device you want on the options list.
Printer specifies that a personal computer printer or a virtual printer is to receive the output.
Disk specifies that a personal computer disk or diskette is to receive the output.
Display is the assumed value.
If you specify Display for the output device and press the Enter key, the transfer request is created.
To display the output, select Run on the action list, and either press the Enter key or press F5 (Run).
The transfer request runs, and the output appears on your personal computer display.
You can send transferred data to a personal computer printer or to a virtual printer.
The following prompts allow you to specify how you want the printed output to look.
It allows you to specify which of the three available printers should receive the output.
One of the following must be specified:
Printer LPT1 Printer LPT2 Printer LPT3 LPT1 is the supplied value.
After you complete the Printer device prompt, the following display appears:
It specifies the length of the print line, in characters.
The supplied value is 80 characters per line.
A transferred record may require more print positions than are available on one print line.
The supplied value is Yes.
It specifies whether column headings are to be printed.
Column headings are the field names you specified in the SELECT prompt.
The supplied value is, On all pages.
Page length This prompt is required.
It specifies the number of lines on one printed page.
The page length can be from 1 to 127 lines, depending on the size of the paper.
Six lines are printed per inch.
Specify a number from 1 to 127; 66 is the supplied value.
From this display, you can change, save, or run the transfer request.
It identifies the name of the personal computer disk or diskette file to receive the transferred records.
Specify the file name using the following format:
Replace old file This prompt is required.
It indicates that you want the file specified in the To prompt replaced with the transferred records.
After you complete the Replace old file prompt, the following display appears:
It identifies the type of personal computer disk or diskette file to receive the transferred records.
ASCII text is the supplied value.
Show format of transferred data This prompt is required.
It specifies whether you want to see the detailed format of the data records to be transferred and, if so, if you want to see it on the personal computer display or the personal computer printer.
This information can be used to help you write a personal computer program to process the data in the personal computer file.
You need only display or print the format of transferred data once for each transfer request.
If you change the FROM or SELECT prompt for the transfer request, you must get a new copy of the format of transferred data by specifying Display or Printer.
If you specify Printer, the format of transferred data is printed on printer LPT1.
Save transfer description This prompt is required.
It specifies whether you want to save the personal computer file description in a personal computer file.
Description file name This prompt is required.
It appears only if you specified Yes for the Save transfer description prompt.
The Description file name prompt specifies the name of the personal computer disk or diskette file to receive the file description.
Use the JOIN BY prompt to specify how data from the files is joined or combined.
Use the Return records with missing fields prompt to specify if records with missing fields are transferred.
You can specify up to 32 files.
If the name of a file does not fit on one FROM prompt input area line, the transfer function automatically creates another input line, or you can create another line by pressing the F9 key.
The name of a file cannot be split between two input area lines.
The following is an example of specifying two files using the FROM prompt:
If you select a library from the list, it is copied to the FROM prompt and is separated by a comma from the previously specified file name.
You can then continue using F4 to help you complete the next file name.
If more than one file name is specified and one of them is not complete (for example, a member name is not specified), you can show a list of items to help you complete that file name.
If you specify only one file name in the FROM prompt, the JOIN BY prompt is not displayed.
Each file specified in the FROM prompt must be joined to at least one other file in the FROM prompt.
Use the JOIN BY prompt to specify one or more join conditions.
In a join condition, you must specify two field names, one field from each file that is joined.
The field lengths or types do not have to be the same.
A character field must be joined to a character field.
The lengths do not have to be the same.
Use T1 for fields defined by the first record format, T2 for the fields defined by the second record format, and so on.
If you do not know the names of the fields in the files specified in the FROM prompt, press F4 when the cursor is in the JOIN BY input area.
You must use more than one join condition if you want to join more than two files or if you want to join together two files by more than one common field.
If you need to specify more than one join condition, the conditions must be connected with AND.
For example: means that records with the same value for EMPNO are joined from the first file and the second file specified in the FROM prompt, and then from the second and third files specified in the FROM prompt.
You can specify a maximum of 32 join conditions.
If all of the join conditions do not fit on one input line, the transfer function automatically creates another line, or you can create another line by pressing the F9 key.
A field name cannot be split between two lines.
After you complete the JOIN BY prompt, you can complete the SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY prompts as described in this chapter.
Return records with missing fields It is possible, while joining records from more than one file, that a record cannot be found to complete the join.
Use this prompt to specify if you want to transfer a record with missing fields.
If you choose to return records with missing fields, values are transferred for the missing fields.
If you do not choose to return records with missing fields, records having missing fields are not transferred.
No, if you do not want data records that contain values for missing fields to be transferred.
Only data records created from records found in all of the files specified in the FROM prompt are transferred.
There might be relationships between these files that you can use to link or join them together as if the data were all in one file.
When the files have been joined together, they can be transferred to the personal computer.
Notice that records in both files contain a part number field.
A new prompt, JOIN BY, specifies the relationship between the two files.
Therefore, in order to join two records in these files, the part numbers must be equal.
In summary, specify the following to get the information described above:
Refers to the first file in the FROM prompt, and T2.
Refers to the second file in the FROM prompt.
To get the same information as described in the previous example, specify the following:
It is possible, while joining records from more than one file, that a record cannot be found to complete the join.
Use the Return records with missing fields prompt to specify if you want to transfer a record with missing field(s).
If you choose to return records with missing fields, supplied values are transferred for the missing fields.
The supplied value for a character field is blanks, and the supplied value for a numeric field is zeros.
This can be used, for example, to compare information in the records of a file.
To transfer the desired information to the personal computer, you could specify the following:
The same file has been specified twice in the FROM prompt.
The JOIN BY prompt specifies to join records having the same part number.
When the part numbers are equal, the two records are joined.
The final result is the following:
When you transfer summary records, one record is transferred for every group of records.
If you want all of the records in only one group, leave the GROUP BY prompt blank.
Use the SELECT prompt to create the summary records.
The SELECT prompt can only specify field names used in the GROUP BY prompt.
Use the HAVING prompt to determine which summary records are to be transferred.
If you want all of the summary records transferred, leave the HAVING prompt blank.
Use the ORDER BY prompt to order the summary records.
You can specify only field names and functions used in the SELECT prompt.
If you do not specify a value for the GROUP BY prompt, the records are treated as one group.
If the GROUP BY prompt is not currently displayed, press the Shift+F4 key to see the GROUP BY prompt.
If the GROUP BY and HAVING prompts are displayed and you do not want to use them, you can press the Shift+F4 key again to have these two prompts removed from the display.
The fields must be defined in a record format specified in the FROM prompt.
If you do not know the names of the fields, press F4 to display a list of all the fields in the record.
If all the names of the fields do not fit on one GROUP BY input area line, the transfer function automatically creates another line, or you can create another line by pressing the F9 key.
If you specify the GROUP BY prompt, the SELECT prompt is required to transfer a summary record for each group.
Use this prompt to specify functions that identify the kind of summary information you want transferred.
The field names you specify for the SELECT prompt (not specified with a function) must also have been specified for the GROUP BY prompt.
The functions and fields you specify for the SELECT prompt return the actual summary information about each group.
Type the field names and the functions in the SELECT prompt in the order that you want them to appear.
The format of a function is: function(field-name) where: function Is one of the following:
This function is allowed only for numeric fields.
Each function returns only one value for each group of records.
A summary record is transferred because functions are selected.
This prompt identifies which summary records are to be transferred.
A condition specifies a test to be done on a summary record.
If you want to transfer all of the summary records, leave the HAVING prompt blank.
The format of a condition is: function(field-name) test value where: function Is one of the functions allowed in the SELECT prompt.
For more information on constants, expressions and tests refer to "Specifying Values in a Transfer Request" in topic 7.12.
Test conditions can be connected with a logical AND or OR.
When both AND and OR are specified, AND comparisons are made first.
If you do not know the names of the fields you want, press F4 to display a list of all the names of the fields in the record.
If a comparison does not fit on one HAVING input area line, the transfer function automatically creates another line, or you can create another line by pressing F9.
A function or a field-name cannot be split between two input area lines.
It identifies the order in which the summary records are to be sorted.
Summary records are sorted by the fields and functions specified.
If no order is specified, ascending order is assumed.
The field names or functions specified in the ORDER BY prompt must also be specified in the SELECT prompt.
For a list of field names, you can press F4.
The functions are listed as they appear in the SELECT prompt.
You can use the WHERE prompt to do this.
The HAVING prompt allows you to select which summary records are transferred.
The final summary records are sorted by the items specified in the ORDER BY prompt.
To run a transfer request, specify Run on the action list and press the Enter key.
If the action list is not on the display, you can run a transfer request by pressing F5 (Run).
If you specified Printer as the output device, the transferred records are printed.
If you specified Disk as the output device, the format of the transferred data (if requested) is sent to the output device (display or printer) you specified for the Show format of transferred data prompt.
The personal computer file description file (if requested in the Save transfer description prompt) is written to a personal computer disk or diskette file, and the transferred records are written to a personal computer disk or diskette file.
You can press the Esc key to cancel running the current transfer request at any time (except while the file description is being written to a disk or diskette).
Any records remaining to be transferred are ignored.
If data is being written to a personal computer disk or diskette file, the file is closed.
If you specified Display for the output device prompt when you created or modified the current transfer request, the transferred records are sent to the display.
The records appear, one record per line on the display.
The output is in column format.
Column headings are the SELECT field names.
The following shows displayed records:
If a field cannot be changed, the field is displayed and the character positions that could not be changed are highlighted.
You can press the Esc key to stop displaying the records.
The display then shows the total number of records that were displayed and the number of displayed records that had data that could not be changed.
The transfer request stops running.
The printer is set to the values that were specified in the transfer request.
If you want to stop printing the transferred records before all of the records are printed, you can press the Esc key.
The display then shows the total number of records printed and the number of printed records that had data that could not be changed.
You can press the Esc key again to remove the totals window.
The format of the transferred data is displayed or printed, as requested in the Show format of transferred data prompt.
The personal computer file description is written to a personal computer disk or diskette file, as requested in the Save transfer description prompt.

Decimal positions This identifies the number of decimal positions in a numeric field.
You can press the Esc key to remove the list.
After the format of transferred data is printed, the window containing the message is removed and the transfer request continues running.
If you specified Yes for the Save transfer description prompt, the following display appears:
After the personal computer file is written, the transfer request continues running.
While records are being written to your disk or diskette, the following display appears:
You must press the Esc key to remove the message window before you can go to the action list.
Pressing the Esc key also stops the transfer request from running.
The entire personal computer file must be transferred.
Any other fields that are not transferred, but are defined for this file, are filled with blanks for character fields and zeros for numeric fields, or the values specified when the file was created.
The transfer function automatically creates the member in the file and library you specified.
The new member is created according to the file description in the existing file.
In this case, specify that a personal computer file description file be used during the transfer.
Note that only the fields that are transferred are defined in the new file.
When you transfer data to this type of file, you need a personal computer file description file to define the data as it exists in the personal computer data file.
Specify an asterisk (*) in the SELECT prompt.
Specify that you do not want to save a personal computer file description file for the personal computer file.
If the router is not active, this input field is blank.
Press F4 to display a list of possible system names.
It identifies the name of the host system physical file that receives the data you send from your personal computer.
You may specify a file that already exists or create a new one.
If you want to create a file to receive the transferred data, you must specify a library name.
If you want to transfer data to an existing file, the newly transferred data replaces data already in the file.
If you do not specify a member name, the data is transferred to the first member in the file *FIRST.
If the member already exists, the old data is replaced with the current data.
If you want to transfer data to an existing file, specify the member name.
The data in the member file is replaced by the transferred data.
The library name, file name, member name, and record format name each can have a maximum of 10 characters.
The format of the FROM prompt is as follows:
You can press F4 to list the file names you can use.
You can also specify a part of a file name using a global file name character (* or?)
In the FROM prompt input area to limit the number of names listed.
Use PC file description This prompt is required.
You do not need a PC file description file if you are transferring a PC file that contains records with text (character data) only.
Yes, for any other situation.
The Description file name prompt specifies the name of the personal computer file description file containing the description of the data to be transferred.
The system supplies a file description name automatically.
This file description name is created using the values you specified in the FROM prompt.
It is recommended that you use the supplied extension.
However, you can specify your own extension.
If you do not want to use any extension, specify only a period (.)
If you do not want to use the supplied file description name, you can enter your own file description name.
If you do not know the name of the personal computer file description file that you want to use, press F4.
This displays a list of all of the file description files on the default disk drive in the current directory.
To limit the number of names listed, enter part of the name using a global file name character (* or?)
In the File description name input area.
In this case, pressing the F4 key lists all of the file description files with names that are the same as the characters you typed.
PC file type This prompt appears only if you specified No for the Transfer data using PC file description prompt.
You must specify the type of personal computer file you named in the FROM prompt.
The supplied value is ASCII text.
For file type No conversion, the data file should contain data that needs no conversion.
If you select No and press the Enter key, the request is created.
Press F5 to run the transfer request.
The description can help you remember the contents of the member at a later time.
For example, this description is displayed when you request a list (using F4) of all the members in a file.
When you complete the Member text prompt, the transfer request is created.
In order to create the member, you must have the following authority:
This member is created with two beginning fields, sequence number and date, in addition to the data fields from your personal computer file.
The maximum amount of data that can be transferred per record is 4096 bytes.
The data portion of the member takes on the characteristics of your personal computer file.
That is, if your personal computer file is an ASCII text file and is made up of many records containing text, the resulting data field will look similar.
This file and member contain only the data fields that are in the personal computer file description file.
If you are not transferring data using a PC file description file, the value for this prompt is assumed to be Source.
Field reference filename This prompt appears only if you specified Yes for the Use PC file description prompt and you are creating a new file.
If you do not specify a library name, then *LIBL is used.
If you type a partial file name followed by an asterisk (*) before pressing the F4 key, a list of file names that you can use, beginning with the partial name, is displayed.
This automatically copies the library name and the file name to the input area for the Field reference filename prompt.
Specify one of the following:
File Text This prompt is optional.
When you complete this prompt, the transfer request is created.
To create the file and member, you must have *READ and *ADD authority for the library that will contain the file.
Specify Run on the action list and press the Enter key.
The following display appears while the transfer request is running:
The personal computer sends the records, one at a time, from the file specified in the FROM prompt.
During this conversion process, it is possible that conversion errors may occur.
For these conversion errors, you receive an error message, the number of the record in the personal computer file in which the error occurred, and, in some cases, information about the specific field in the record containing the error.
In this case, you must stop the transfer request, correct the error, and run the transfer request again.
If you choose to continue transferring data, and the error occurs in the same place in another record, you do not receive another message.
In this case, the transfer function automatically continues running the transfer request.
When the transfer request ends, the transfer function displays the number of records that had errors.
You can end the transfer at any time by pressing the Esc key.
If any conversion errors occurred while the transfer request was running, you will see additional messages in the Status display These messages tell you the number of records that had a particular conversion error.
Error message 8154 occurred, and you chose to continue running the transfer request.
This status message shows the number of records that had this error.
N record(s) had data that was truncated:
N record(s) had numeric data with too many digits:
To create or change a translation table, use the translation table utility.
After creating or changing a translation table, you may need to add or change some entries in your PC Support configuration file.
After you are done with the status information, press the Esc key to return to the action list.
This section describes how to change the current transfer request.
After you change a transfer request, you can use the action list to save or run it.
You can change the transfer request by moving the cursor to any field and typing the changes you want to make.
You can also automatically run the saved transfer request using the automatic transfer function.
For details, refer to "Using the Automatic Transfer Function Programs" in topic 7.11.
You should save a transfer request if you need to transfer the same information often.
Saving a transfer request prevents you from having to create a transfer request each time you want to transfer this information.
To save a transfer request, select Save on the action list and press the Enter key.
If you want a list of all the transfer request names on the disk or diskette, you can press F4.
To limit the number of names listed, specify part of a name using a global file name character (* or?)
In the transfer request name input area.
In this case, pressing F4 lists all of the transfer request names that are the same as the characters you typed.
If you specify only a period (.)
You can use the Arrow keys to find the transfer request name you want, and then you can press the Enter key to select it.
This automatically copies the name from the list to the transfer request name input area.
The option you select determines if the data in the file is automatically replaced.
Yes, if the file should be replaced (if it exists).
No, if the file should not be replaced.
If you are creating the file (it does not already exist), you should specify Yes.
It allows you to type a short description of the transfer request.
The description can be up to 40 characters long.
If you selected the transfer request name from a list, the description is automatically copied into the input area for this prompt.
The transfer request is saved in the specified personal computer disk or diskette file.
The transfer request is saved in a personal computer file that is intended for use only by the transfer function.
You must specify the transfer request using the following format:
If you want a list of all the transfer request file names on the disk or diskette, press F4.
In this case, pressing F4 lists all the transfer request names that are the same as the characters you typed.
For the extension, no extension is used.
This automatically copies the selected name to the transfer request name input area.
After you type the transfer request name, press the Enter key.
The transfer request is read from the disk or diskette and becomes the current transfer request.
You can end the transfer function by selecting Exit on the action list and pressing the Enter key.
There are two interactive programs:
To start the interactive transfer of data from the host system to the personal computer type: where: transfer-request-filename is the name of the transfer request previously created and saved.
To start the interactive transfer of data from the personal computer to the host system type: where: transfer-request-filename is the name of the transfer request previously created and saved.
The automatic transfer function programs run a previously created and saved transfer request without prompting you for information.
To create and save a transfer request, you must use the interactive transfer function.
To start the program, enter the following command at the DOS prompt: where transfer-request-filename specifies the name of a transfer request that was previously created and saved.
The transfer-request-filename is required.
The file name can be from 1 to 8 characters long and is required in the command.
The extension consists of a period (.) and 3 characters immediately following the file name with no characters following it, no extension is used.
Your transfer request is running After the transfer request runs, the transferred records are sent to the output device specified in the transfer request.
If you specified Display for the Output device prompt, the transferred records are sent to the display.
Each record is shown using one or more lines of the display, depending on the length of the record.
The output is printed by the values specified in the transfer request.
If you are printing on a virtual printer, these characteristics might not be reset.
The format of transferred data is being printed You can press the Esc key to stop printing the format of transferred data.
If you specified that the personal computer file description should be saved, the following message appears while the file description is being written to the specified disk or diskette file:

That is, if you specify only uppercase characters, a search is made only for uppercase letters.
If you specify only lowercase characters, a search is made only for lowercase letters.
A number may include an optional sign (+ or -) and an optional decimal point.
Either a period (.) or a comma (, ) can be used for the decimal point.
The specified field must be a character field.
The string may contain any character.
The percent (\%{}) character represents any character string of zero or more characters.
The underscore (\_{}) character represents any single character.
The following examples show the use of the LIKE test:
The constants must be separated by AND.
The constants must be separated by blanks and enclosed in parentheses; up to 100 constants can be specified.
Tests can be combined with a logical AND or OR.
A maximum of 50 conditions can be specified.
A comparison can start on one line and end on the next line.
The batch return codes are as follows.
You have the option of changing the way the message function operates.
If you use the PC Support editor, you must make the changes in the configuration file yourself.
The work station function and the message function use the same message queue.
Therefore, if you start the work station function before you start the message function, you can only use the message function to send messages.
You also have the option of starting the message function automatically each time PC Support is started or of starting it manually yourself from a command line.
Select Message function from the list of functions on the menu.
From this window you can select to start the message function automatically or manually.
Enter values for the following prompts * Host system that controls the messages.
Enter the name of the system you want to send messages to and receive messages from.
If you do not specify a system name, your default system is used.
This prompt determines how you receive your messages.
A default value of 60 seconds is specified for this prompt.
You can enter a number from 1 to 3600.
If you do not want to use the configuration program, you can use the PC Support Editor to prepare the message function for use.
For the remainder of this chapter, reference will be made to the configuration file.
When you add or change any of the configuration file commands or identifiers, the changes are not in effect until the next time you enter the STARTMSG command.
The extension consists of a period and up to 3 characters.
If used, the extension must immediately follow the file name.
STARTMSG allows the user to specify an alternative configuration file.
This configuration file can be used to set or change the configuration for automatically receiving messages.
To do this, you need to add the following entry to an alternative configuration file:
If there is an up or down arrow on the upper right corner of the display, you can see more information by pressing the Page Up or Page Down keys.
You must run STARTMSG to put this into effect.
If you want to change the monitor that displays the messages, issue another STARTMSG command on the monitor you want to display the messages.
Enter the following command at the DOS command line: where d: and path are the drive and directory containing the message function program.
Online information is available for each display and prompt.
For more information about the interactive message command, refer to the PC Support User's Guide for DOS.
You can enter the first part of a two-part user identification (ID) by which the user is known within the distribution network.
The person sending the message must be enrolled in the directory also.
Using directory entries, you can send messages to user groups, users at other systems, and local users.
This address can be from 1 to 8 characters long.
There can be up to 127 characters in the message.
This can be a host system that is on the local area network or one that is remote to the current default host system.
The default when this parameter is not specified is to leave the messages in the message queues.
The file name can be from 1 to 8 characters.
When this command is issued, all message sessions are stopped (whether the sessions are active or not).
The format is: where d: and path are the drive and directory containing the message function program.
If an error occurs, but STARTMSG is able to continue, the error level is 10.
Receive messages that were sent to your PC location.
The default for this parameter is 60 seconds.
Some programs may affect the way you receive messages.
It is recommended that the personal computer location name be different from the user ID, so that you can receive messages sent either to your personal computer or to your user ID.
You may want to end and remove a PC Support function from memory so the memory can be used with other DOS applications.
In order for the programs to work, they must communicate with each other.
To communicate, they must share a common language.
PC Support provides several different router programs.
The first of these is the PC location name.
When PC Support was installed, the installation program requested this information.
If necessary, you can change it using the PC Suppor configuration program.
Use the PC Support configuration program to do this.
It is also necessary for you to identify yourself to the router program.
This can be the same user ID you use to sign on to a work station session.
If you choose not to provide a unique user ID, the router program uses a common user ID.
If necessary, you can use the configuration program to change your user ID.
It is also the most important task.
The information in this section applies to all router types.
It was entered into the file when PC Support was installed.
When the STARTRTR program is run, it determines if the router is active or inactive.
As it searches the file, it looks for identifier information corresponding to the PC location name, system name, and router type.
For a description of the additional identifier information, refer to the specific section in this chapter describing your router type.
STARTRTR /D the status of the router is displayed.
When you enter the following command at the DOS prompt:
STARTRTR /R the information in the router error log is reset.
STARTRTR /B the error notify option within the router is turned on or off.
You can use one or the other.
Also, you can only specify one command line parameter at a time.
Use either the STOPRTR command or the remove PC Support function to stop the router.
For example, release any assigned shared folders function drives.
- Enter the following command after the DOS prompt:
If you have virtual printers assigned when you enter STOPRTR, it is recommended that you do not force the router to stop.
To ensure that all of the data is sent to the printer and the printer file is closed, you must use the SETVPRT command to release the virtual printers.
Then enter the STOPRTR command again.
To use the remove PC Support function, enter the following command after the DOS prompt:
Follow the prompts on the menu and press F1 (Help) for additional help information when necessary.
If you need more information about the remove PC Support function, refer to the manual PC Support User's Guide for DOS.
The information in this section applies to all PC Support router types.
You can use the PC Support configuration program to change the PC location name, default user ID, and software interrupt number.
You should consider the following points before making any changes.
In most cases, you do not want to change this.
You can define a default user ID to use with all of the systems you have access to.
Personal computer applications use this number when communicating with the router.
Enter values for the prompts in the window.
The following list describes the prompts and the values you can enter.
Press F1 (Help) for additional help information.
In most cases, you will not change this value from that specified when PC Support was installed.
It is specified when PC Support is installed.
- Do not put any blank spaces in the name.
If you supply a value for this prompt, it must be 1 to 10 characters long.
The default for this prompt is 68.
In most cases, you will not need to change this number.
If you do, specify a number between 60 and 68.
Press the Enter key after you have entered the values.
Start your personal computer and the router again if the router was already running.
Or, use the remove PC Support function to remove the router from memory, and then enter the STARTRTR command again.
If you use an IBM Token-Ring Network, you have the ability to attach more than one device to the network and have all the devices on the network communicate.
It does not need to pass through one system to communicate with another.
DOS must be loaded on the personal computer.
See the correct DOS manuals to determine how to load DOS.
You can use the PC Support configuration program and the translation table utility without the router being active.
However, the router must be active to use any of the other functions of PC Support.
This connection is called a link.
You can operate PC Support using the set up provided, or you can use the PC Support configuration program to add to or change the information in the file.
The information is in the form of a four-character identifier.
The following list shows the configuration file information used to set up the adapter.
The actual four-character identifier found in the configuration file follows in parentheses.
Stopping and starting the router with the STOPRTR and STARTRTR commands does not cause the TRAL and TRAS identifiers to take effect.
When the router is stopped by the STOPRTR command, the adapter remains in an open condition; therefore, the TRAL and the TRAS configuration file identifiers do not take effect if the router is started again.
The amount of adapter-shared memory remains fixed.
The adapter-shared memory is divided into two areas.
The same configuration file information used to open and set up the adapter is used to affect the size of the adapter-shared memory.
If you do need to change the values, keep them as small as possible.
You can use the PC Support configuration program to change these values.
When you add a link using the configuration program, each TRLI entry contains the name of the link you want established and the adapter address of the remote system you want to connect to.
For information on the configuration program, refer to Chapter 2, "Configuring PC Support with the Configuration Program."
You must know the adapter address of each of these systems.
It is the one you use most often from day to day.
The adapter address of this system is 1000A7001234.
The first parameter on the TRLI entry is the link name.
As each entry is processed, an attempt is made to communicate to the system with the specified adapter address.
The first link started (in this example, the department system) is always the default link.
This means that all the virtual print and transfer function requests are directed to this system.
You can create the alternative configuration file using the PC Support configuration file.
To do this, enter the STARTRTR command with the name of the configuration file.
When you set up the TRLI entry, you can specify an action to be performed on the link.
Specify the Release action to release a link.
When you are done using this printer, you may want to release any virtual printers you have assigned to it and then stop the link.
Then, complete the steps for adding a link, being sure to specify the Release action.
If this were also the default link, the router would search its link table for the first active link.
In this case, that is the DEPT link.
DEPT then becomes the new default link.
Press the Tab key to move to the next prompt.
IBM Token-Ring network adapter: This prompt does not have a default.
When you have more than one adapter installed in your personal computer, you must tell the router which adapter to use.
The primary adapter uses 0 as its adapter number.
The secondary adapter uses 1 as its number.
IBM Token-Ring Source SAP in hex: This prompt is optional.
You should specify the hexadecimal code for the value you want to use.
Specify the maximum number of systems you want to communicate with at one time.
IBM Token-Ring number of additional SAP stations: This prompt is optional.

The SDLC router needs to know if your modem supports the automatic dial function.
To use the automatic dial feature of the SDLC router, you should use the PC Support configuration program to specify the automatic dial command and number.
Then you can use the automatic dial function of the SDLC router.
The SDLC router needs to know if your modem provides this function.
The router displays any error messages that come back from the modem.
The router displays this message:
Try the call again later.
Press Esc to stop waiting.
The method used depends on the modem used.
When the applications have finished running, you should enter the STOPRTR command on your personal computer to end the communications link.
There are several temporary line errors and permanent line errors that can occur when using the SDLC or PC Support asynchronous router.
Occurs when an SDLC link error has occurred.
Occurs when the SDLC router receives an unexpected command from the host system.
This is a permanent link error.
The error notify option is a feature that sounds an alarm on your personal computer when either a temporary or permanent error is logged.
For example, if you entered STARTRTR /d, the following information may appear on your display:
Asynchronous data transmission is a means of sending information across a communications link between two computers or between a computer and a device, such as an ASCII work station.
You can use the configuration program to set up your PC Support asynchronous router connection.
Enter values for the prompts displayed.
The identifier associated with each prompt follows in parentheses.
This value identifies the port number in the personal computer that the router uses.
This value is the number of data bits per byte.

You can use a batch command or interactive displays to operate the remove PC Support function.
The PC Support User's Guide for DOS contains detailed information about using the remove PC Support function.
This section describes how to configure the remove PC Support function.
You can use the PC Support configuration program described in Chapter 2, "Configuring PC Support with the Configuration Program" to change the path from which the remove PC Support function program is started.
This is referred to as the run path for the function.
You can change the run path using the PC Support configuration program.
Therefore, some commands are not as useful as others.
You can do this from the PC Support menu or from the DOS command line prompt.
This information in the following section describes how to configure the submit remote command function.
The PC Support update function does this for you automatically when you start PC Support.
It is important that you run the PC Support update function as a part of starting PC Support because this function gives you the correct level of PC Support programs.
PC Support uses the PCS directory as its default directory.
If you do this, you must tell the PC Support update function to update the PC Support files in the requested directory.
The PC Support update function replaces only the programs that you have in the requested directory on your personal computer.
This could be the PCS directory or a directory of your own.
All files found in the requested directory on your personal computer are checked with the corresponding files in the source directory and are updated if the time and date are different.
If necessary, the update function will tell you to start your personal computer again.
Because the PC Support update function provides you with the correct level of code, it is important that you run the update function as part of starting PC Support.
For example, you could use the PC Support editor.
You should run the PC Support update function on the other working diskettes that contain PC Support programs.
This parameter is optional and, if specified, must be an existing directory.
If not specified, the current drive and directory are used.
/L indicates that the programs that should be updated are to be listed and not updated.
This is an optional parameter.
If the time and date are different from the host system file time and date, the file is updated.
If /L was not specified, the files were updated successfully.

If you issue a command that uses one of these files or programs, PC Support may issue an error message.
EMLI identifier: the link name, work station address, and user ID parameters have been added to this identifier.
The following identifiers have been added:
For example, only systems attached to the same IBM Token-Ring Network as your personal computer can have a link attachment to your personal computer.
If your personal computer connection is twinaxial, you can have only one link attachment.
The ADRS identifier is used to add system attachments.
ADRS identifies the system attachment and the link attachment system to be used.
For example, you already have the maximum number (32) of active names in the router internal system name table, and you want to use a system that is not in the table.
The formats for these identifiers are:
You must specify a remote system name parameter on the ADRS entry for the system with which you have a link.
Refer to Appendix D, "Configuring PC Support Using the Editor," for more information on how to specify a remote system name parameter on the ADRS entry.
When using multiple systems with PC Support, the systems should be at the same security level.
You can use the STARTRTR command to use the message function on a remote system.
Refer to Appendix D, "Configuring PC Support Using the Editor," for the format of this entry.
If no match is found, the router looks at the remote system names (if any are currently set up by the router).
The message function is active on only one system at a time.

Sending and/or receiving information by writing or reading to a program device.
The chapter also includes a description of the read and write operations that specify a record format containing specific communication functions.
Refer to appendix B for more information about return codes and to the appropriate language reference manuals for more information about the high-level language file status.
For more information about the language interface, refer to the appropriate language reference manual.
Before running application programs on your system you must define the proper application environment.
This interface is made up of a set of commands and operations.
The commands allow you to manage the attributes of the file and the operations allow a program to use the file.
Commands allow you to create, delete, change and display the file description.
The following commands are valid for APPC applications.
This command allows you to delete a file from the system.
This command displays the file description of any file on the system.
The information may be printed or displayed.
This command displays the description of the fields in any file on the system.
This command allows you to permanently add a program device entry that contains a program device name, remote location information, and session level attributes.
Refer to the CL Reference, for the syntax of the commands.
Enter the name by which the user program will refer to this communications session.
Enter the name of the remote location that should be associated with the program device.
Specify the name of the device that is associated with the remote location.
Specifies that the local location name specified in the system network attributes is used.
Specifies that the mode specified in the system network attributes is used.
Specifies that the remote network ID for the remote location should be used.
If several remote network IDs are associated with the remote location, the system automatically selects the remote network ID.
Specifies the remote network ID specified in the network attributes is used.
The program determines what record formats are selected.
The remote format name received from the sending system is used to do record selection.
Specifies that the system gives the length and general data stream identifier values that go before each section of user data in APPC communications.
The application gives the data portion of the general data stream on output operations and receives only the data portion of the general data stream on input operations.
Specifies that the application program gives the length and general data stream identifier values that go before each section of user data.
The application gives the length and general data stream values in the first 4 bytes of output data and receives the length and general data stream values in the first 4 bytes of input data.
In an APPC communications environment, no single system is responsible for the control of all sessions.
The application program does not directly interface to a session.
A locally controlled session is selected if one is available.
If no locally controlled session is available, then an available remotely controlled session will be used.
A session gives the application program a logical connection to the remote location.
Once the application program is connected to the session, it needs to establish communications with the target program.
The application program is responsible for, and only sends or receives, the user data portion of the data stream.
That is, these bytes are passed, as is, to or from the user buffer along with the other data on input and output operations.
Your programs do not need to blank fill the output buffer beyond that length.
The session is either controlled by your system (locally controlled), or controlled by the remote system (remotely controlled).
It is only valid when your program is not already communicating with another program on the same session.
The number and format of the parameters is defined by the target program.
To determine the total length of the data to be sent, use the following formula:
If you want the program initialization parameter data to be treated as individual parameters by the System/36, you should code your user buffer with each parameter separated by a comma.
Refer to "APPC Security Considerations" in topic 7.4 for information about APPC security.
Your program must be in send state.
If there is no data in the buffer to send, no operations are performed.
The confirm function causes any data currently held in the buffer to be sent, including any data on a write operation that specified the confirm function.
Your application program uses the read operation to obtain data or control information from the remote system.
The fail function causes an error code to be sent to the remote system, indicating that the fail function was issued.
No data can be sent with a fail function.
The last record before the fail function was issued is still sent to the remote program.
The record sent by the output operation should identify what the error is and where the remote program should start again.
Data received by APPC, but not yet given to the application program, is lost after a fail function has been received.
In either case, the program that issued the fail function should send, and the program that receives the fail must receive.
Otherwise, the program that was sending cannot determine which record failed or with which record it should begin sending again.
If both programs issue a fail function at the same time, the program that was receiving will be successful and should send.
The program that was sending will receive a fail return code.
The remote program, however, must decide whether to stop sending and when to stop.
Your program, in response to the return code, can then begin sending its data, perform other processing, or end.
Your program uses the get-attributes operation to determine the status of the session.
It can be issued at any time during a session.
If the release operation is not successful, the end-of-session function can be issued to end the session.
If the session is associated with a target program, the release operation only temporarily ends the connection to the program.
If the close operation is issued to a session associated with a target program, the connection to the program is only temporarily ended.
Your application program should take the appropriate recovery action.
The same messages are used whether the program is in send or receive state.
Mode: This field contains the name of the mode to which the session is attached.
Your program can do one of the following:
If it is a target program, end the session and continue local processing or go to end of job.
Another example would be a major code of 83.
In this case either the local system, remote system, or remote program has detected an error that may be recoverable.
If your program receives this return code, or any of the other fail return codes, it should perform an input operation to allow the remote program to send the appropriate error recovery information.
In this situation, the remote program is responsible for the necessary error recovery.
For this return code, your program is responsible for the necessary error recovery.
This causes the target program, with which the source program is going to communicate, to be started.
The target program always starts in the receive state.
A write operation issued with a fail function may also be used if your program is to send an error condition to the remote system.
When a program is in the receive state, it must continue to issue input operations until one of the following is received:
For example, any of the 80 major return codes.
The message is normal if there is no need for the target program to communicate with the source program.
No error is indicated because it is valid for a target program on one session to be a source program on another session.
The CPI9803 message contains the unit-of-work ID for the job.
Refer to appendix F, for information about specifying location information.
This allows your program to issue subsequent output operations.
If the receiving program performs complex processing on each record, the delay time can be significant.
The following information describes how the end-of-session, close, and release functions are used to end communications between your local program and the target program.
When a permanent session error occurs, the source program is responsible for recovery.
You can use the end-of-session function to end the session associated with a job.
In this case, the job is no longer shown as active.
The unit-of-work identifier can be found in three places within the system.
That message contains the job name and the unit-of-work identifier.
Select option 1 from the Display Job display to display the unit-of-work identifier.
The unit-of-work identifier shown at both systems will be the same.
Level 20: a password is required for the user to sign on; the user can access all system resources.
However, you can still use application level security if the remote system supports it.
This provides the security parameters (profile ID, password, or user ID) that the remote system might require.
The user ID must exist on the remote system.
Option indicators are allowed, and are required if the keyword is specified more than once for a format.
If the remote system allows a default user ID, it would accept this type of security request.
The field defined cannot be longer than 10 characters.
Profile ID cannot be specified when using system-supplied formats.
When specified for the user ID and security is to be sent to the remote system, APPC will use the user's profile on the local system to send in the security field.
If security is not to be sent, no user ID will be sent.
The user's password is not retrieved and sent.
If security is not to be sent, no password will be sent.
A valid user ID and password are supplied.
When local verification of the user ID is performed, only the user ID is passed between secure systems on the network.
Any user on a remote system having a user ID the same as a local user ID has access to the local system with all of the authority of the local user.
It is possible for an invalid password to be entered by a remote user.
The system identifies the error as an invalid password.
The resulting hexadecimal character is a 2.
Automatic disconnect of switched connections occurs when there are no sessions currently active for a particular controller.
The control points have previously established a control-point-to-control-point session over another parallel transmission group.
This timer is set when the controller is made active.
If there is no session activity, then the automatic disconnect process is started.
If a session is established and ended before the timer ends, the line will not disconnect until the timer ends.
If the timer ends while the session is active, the line will disconnect when the session ends.
In the first case, the link is available for use.
There are default values that are used for these characteristics.
When a session is requested from the System/36, the remote location name is used to find the location.
The following list provides the most common uses of the available information.
This information may be useful in determining the cause of network problems.
The values shown on the following displays are the default values.

Position to: Specify all or part of the control point name at which to start the list of control point names.
A default network ID is displayed, however, you may change it.
If a NO is indicated for a control point, this means that the control point is not used for routing.
You may display additional characteristics of a displayed link by selecting option 5 (Display link characteristics) and pressing the Enter key.
If NO is indicated for a link, this means that the link is not used for routing.
User defined (1,2,3): Each field displays a value from 0 through 255 as defined by the user.
Position to: Specify all or part of the location name at which to start the list of location names.
It displays the names of all remote control points for which information exists in the local directory.
Type your options and press the Enter key.
Position to: Specify the location name at which to start the list of location names.
Using type: This prompt is only displayed when you press F11 (Sort by type).
When the Using type prompt is displayed, F11 changes to Sort by location.
This allows you to display the list again, this time, sorted by location name.
It can be one of the following values:
One or more of them may have already ended.

From RESVM2:
Also, you know that these two files are not the same length and you want the longer one printed first.
If you try, you will receive error message 646E.
If this operator is logged on any one of his user IDs, there is not a problem.
The link could have been in one of several other states:
This response tells you how many files are in the queue for link PRINTER1.
This example shows two file states: sending and waiting.
Files can have the following states:
(See Table 10 in topic A.11.2 for a list of options.).
You need to know the local (or current) spool ID of the file.
Any subsequent failure on the link causes the retry procedure to begin again.
To help your operators analyze the state of your network, you may want to provide tools that can perform several tasks.
The second column tells you the message number.
Note that the last line has 0001 as the message number.
The first character tells you what kind of message line it is:
The last character is either an L or a blank.
The rest of the message lines contain the actual message information you requested.
Notice that the first five columns remain the same.
Lines 0012 and 0013 are different from the first 11 lines.
Line 0012 starts out like the previous 11 lines by having a three-character length (002) followed by two characters of data (11).
After that, you see:
D08D01*** When the three-character length field starts with the letter D, it indicates a dictionary term.
In the second column of line 0012, you see 0620, which tells you the message number.
This would allow you to send files out over the link, but would prevent others from sending files to you.
(See topic A.46 for more information about the SET command.).
For example, the SET command format is:
(See topic A.51.).
START has limited functional capabilities when issued by a link operator.
(See with topic A.51.).
Each of these commands has two formats: a VM user format and an operator format.
Since you are an authorized operator for another link, you must specify the link ID on the VM user format of the command.
Note the following about the first column of this table:
The comment command is available to all classes of users and operators.
The delimiter must be a period (.).
The CHANGE command has two formats.
All other operators must specify a link ID.
The options for the operator format are the same as for the VM user format, with one addition:
The name (or names) must be from one to four characters.
The maximum value of nnn (number of copies) is 255 (leading zeros are optional).
The maximum value is 255 (leading zeros are optional).
The name must be one to four characters.
Use this option when the operator changes the class or the forms on the printer while a file with multiple copies is printing.
Priority 1 is the highest and priority 9 is the lowest.
Valid addresses are X'0000' and X'0002' to X'1FFF'.
The value specified overrides a device address that may have been previously defined for the link.
It is ignored for all other link types.
Start-point can be any decimal number between 1 and 10,000; stop-point can be any decimal number between 0 and 9,999.
The start value must be greater than the stop value.
The following types can be specified:
You must specify the link type before using the START command to activate the link.
See the Usage Note below for a list of valid signs.
To specify a generic entry point name, specify an asterisk (*) as the last character of the name.
GSM016EP, GSM019EP, and GSM032EP.
If this option is not specified, only the current copy is deleted and the next copy, if any, is processed.
Only specific link IDs are allowed.
This value can be any decimal number from 1 to 999, with a default of 4.
For example, if you specified the following statement in your configuration file:
These trace records are identified by a two-digit hexadecimal number.
No new sessions will be allowed to start.
Any SNA-related initialization is then performed.
You must specify at least one filter, but you may specify more than one.
You can only specify one option.
To request specific information about a specific link, use one of these options:
If you specify a filter, you can only specify one.
If it becomes necessary to re-IPL, these addresses may change.
There are four possible states: starting, ready, stopping, or stopped.
Requests information about dial-up ports.
Requests information about files in the queue.
This information includes a summary of the files for each link.
(Only private messages cannot be shared..)
Requests information about the current shift number.
You must use a blank before and after sign to separate it from the option and the number.
Sign can be any one of the following:
You must separate the options and the signs with blanks.
(Remote work station operators cannot use the SET command..)
Only messages marked as private cannot be shared.
Specify at least one of the following:
This value must be less than the value specified for START.
When you do not specify a start value, it becomes 0 (zero) and it is automatically less than the stop value.
It can also be used to cause an active link to begin processing files of a specified set of classes or forms.
If the form name is *, files with any form are processed.
In addition, the work station operator is allowed to check and adjust forms alignment when changing forms.
The "name" can be one to eight characters in length.
The value specified overrides a value that may have been previously defined for the link.
This option is valid only when starting an inactive link.
For more information about the TRACE command, see topic A.53.
Each link type has its own operation parameters.
Only the first 16 and last 16 bytes in the data buffer are logged.
LOG is the default function.
General VM users can only transfer one file at a time.
The name(s) must be from one to four characters.
You must specify a user ID (or SYSTEM) if you also specify a priority.
There are three types of options: link options, system options, and user options.
Are determined by the installation.

The numbers appear to the left of the source statements.
C Sequence error indicator column:
An S in this column indicates that the line is out of sequence.
E Change/date field:
The date the line was last modified is listed here.
It contains information about names in the COBOL source program.
G Level of data item:
The level number of the data item, as specified in the source program, is listed here.
The data name, as specified in the source program, is listed here.
The section where the item was defined is shown here through the use of the following codes:
The offset, in bytes, of the item from the level-01 group item is given here.
The decimal length of the item is listed here.
The data class type for the item is shown here through the use of the following codes:
The sequence number and column number are given for each time the message is issued.
The names are listed alphabetically.
The statement number where the name was defined within the source program is listed here.
An * following a statement number indicates that the item was modified in that statement.
The reference number is issued here (see note.)
When a message is issued for a record from a copy file, the number is preceded by a +.
The statement number and the reference number do not appear on certain messages that reference missing items.
These fields contain the message number and its associated severity level.
This field lists the total number of messages and the number of messages by severity level.
There are many ways to run a COBOL program, depending on how the program is written and who is using the program.
Any COBOL program can call another program with the COBOL CALL statement.
The menu shown in this figure is normally displayed by a control language program in which each option calls a separate COBOL program.
You can also create a command yourself to run a COBOL program by using a command definition.
See the CL Reference for more information about control language commands.
This data must be placed immediately following the CL CALL for the COBOL program.
If more data is requested than is available, the CL statement following the data is treated as input data.
When you run a COBOL program, run-time inquiry messages may be generated.
The messages require a response from you before the program continues running.
The following COBOL/400 inquiry messages can be added to the system reply list:
If a match occurs, the reply value in that entry is used.
If no entry exists for that inquiry message, a reply is required.
No special source code is required for using the OS/400 functions.
See the CL Reference for more information.
As well, you can use the same file name in the program for either testing or normal processing.
For normal processing, the test library should not be named in the library list for that job.
All testing functions are specified in the job that contains the program, not in the actual program.
The errors made most frequently by COBOL programmers are listed in this section.
(For example, your description is correct, but one or more records were entered incorrectly..)
Moving a data item whose subscript or index is too large, is negative, or is 0.
This may result in a decimal data error.
Do not use an index-name or index data-item as a subscript.
For more information on how to code variables in CL commands, see the CL Reference.
These commands are explained in the CL Reference.
This procedure is explained in more detail in the CL Reference.
A trace is a record of some or all of the statements run in a program.
If requested, a trace also records the values of specific variables used in the program statements.
You specify which statements the system will trace.
You can also specify that variables be displayed only when their value has changed since the last trace statement was run.
You can specify a trace of one statement in a program, a group of statements in a program, or all the statements in an entire program.
The value indicates the run status of the statement.
No START statements are specified for the file.
For database files, you may not see all changes as they occur, if the changes are made in different programs.
Both the D option and the F option will dump the first 256 characters of program variables.
Any variable greater than 256 characters will be truncated.
If you do not want a dump, specify C (cancel with no dump.)
Figure 3-7 shows an example of a COBOL formatted dump.
A dump is usually available if something goes wrong when you try to run your program.
The following list describes the areas of Figure 3-7 indicated by letters:
This information is produced only if at least one I-O operation has been processed.
This information is produced only if the program has files.
This chapter describes the COBOL/400 language extensions that support work stations and program-to-program communication.
The records in this file can be described to the COBOL program by the Format 2 COPY statement.
The program or the record format in the device file can provide output fields.
An output/input field is an output field that can be changed to become an input field.
Output/input fields are used when the user is to change or update the data that is written to the display from the program.
For a list of the valid data description specifications (DDS) keywords, see the DDS Reference.
Figure 4-1 shows an example of the DDS for a display device file:
The operating system provides device control information for performing input/output operations for the device.
In addition, the operating system can pass indicators to the program indicating which, if any, fields in the record have changed.
The operating system provides the necessary device control information to display the record.
The order in which the fields are displayed is based on the display positions (line numbers and positions) assigned to the fields in the DDS.
Therefore, the order in which the fields are specified in the DDS and the order in which they appear on the screen need not be the same.
Response indicators provide response information to a program from a device, such as function keys pressed by a work station user, and whether data has been entered.
If a Format 2 COPY statement is used to copy indicators into a source program, the indicators are defined in the order in which they are specified in the DDS for the file.
In a READ statement, the identifier size should be equal to the number of response indicators.
Figure 4-4 shows the associated DDS for the file.
The associated DDS for Figure 4-6 is Figure 4-4.
The associated DDS for the file is the same as Figure 4-7.
Indicator 99 will be set on when you press F3, and so on.
Data and indicator values are written to the work station screen.
The data description entries for the indicators are not generated because a separate indicator area has been specified for the file.
If you have pressed F5, IN51 is set on.
The use of such data items is not required.
The program processes one record at a time, but the operating system and the work station send and receive blocks of records.
For an example of the use of multiple device files, see Figure 4-13.
The program uses a display file, and is intended to be run in batch mode.
Example of the Use of Multiple Device Files + 2.
This variable is used to determine which program device was used to sign on.
Only the fields that are copied are named fields.
Refer to item 13.
If these files are program described, only simple display formatting can be performed.
All field-level descriptions are defined in the COBOL program.
This entry also specifies other information related to the file.
Format Device specifies the type of device associated with the file.
Data-name-6 is assumed to have the following format: 01 data-name-6.
(Record format) Data-name-6 must be 2, 12, or 22 characters long.
The information is in the fixed format as shown in the following example:
This clause is required in every file description entry.
The sections that follow describe the statements involved and their usage.
For a display file, the program device name must match the display device.
For more information about these commands, see the CL Reference.
The indicators can control how the record is displayed and the various data management functions.
When a data record is read, indicators can be read with it.
The indicators can be used to pass information about the data record and how it was entered into your program.
By defining a format using DDS, you determine what functions are to be controlled by indicators, and which indicators control a particular function.
The READ statement makes available a record from a device, using a named format.
Codes A through D are explained below.
Program processing stops until data becomes available.
The program device is assumed to be that single device.
Format 5 cannot be used for communications devices.
For all other cases, with the record following the record that was read by a previous read operation.
In this case, a value of 1 is assumed.
You must specify whether the write is before or after the roll, the range of lines you want to roll, how many lines you want to roll these lines, and whether the roll operation is up or down.
See the DDS Reference manual for more information on DDS keywords.
An initial screen format, FMT1, is written on the work station screen.
The program processes this screen format and is now ready to write the next screen format, FMT2, to the work station screen.
The contents of lines 14 through 18 now appear on lines 16 through 20.
The USE statement specifies procedures for input/output error handling that are in addition to the standard procedures provided by the input/output control system.
This message is displayed if indicator 99 is set to ON by the program.
In addition, this record format defines a function key that you can press to end the program.
When you press function key F3, indicator 15 is set to ON in the COBOL program.
This indicator is then used to end the program.
These constants identify the fields to be written out from the program.
All of these fields are described as output fields (blank in position 38) because they are filled in by the program; you do not enter any data into these fields.
To enter another customer number, press Enter in response to this record.
In addition to describing the constants, fields, and attributes for the screen, the record formats also define the line numbers and horizontal positions where the constants and fields are to be displayed.
The data description specifications (DDS) for the database file that is used by this program describe one record format:
The complete source listing for this program example is shown here.
This record prompts you to enter a customer number.
When you receive this message, the keyboard locks.
You must press the Reset key in response to this message to unlock the keyboard.
You can then enter another customer number.
You can enter another customer number or end the program.
To end the program, press F3, which sets on indicator 15 in the program.
The program then returns control to the individual who called the COBOL program.
XMPLE773 displays all the detail order records for the requested order number.
You end the program by pressing F12.
This display appears if there are detail order records for the customer whose order number was entered in the first display:
For the related DDS, see Figure 4-36.
If no customer record exists for a customer number, an error message is issued.
The output file has the identical order.
(In this case, no file status is set.)
Follow the parts of the diagram that apply to your statements.
All files used are defined to the operating system.
This file name points to the system file description:
For example, the device might be a printer; only the default line and page control or those defined in the DDS would be used:
At run time, checking occurs to ensure that the specifications within the COBOL program are valid for the file being processed.
Output spooling is valid for batch and interactive jobs.
The description of the file that is specified in COBOL by the system-name contains the specification for spooling as shown in the following example:
For example, you can direct the printer output to a different device, such as a diskette.
Not used at level-01 or level-77.
You must specify any overrides before the file is opened by the COBOL program.
The system uses the file override command to determine the file to open and the attributes of the file.
Then, before the COBOL program is run, the number of printed copies of output can be changed to 3.
The override command is as follows:
Device-dependent specifications in the COBOL program are ignored, and the defaults are taken by the system.
The COBOL programmer must ensure that file overrides are applied properly.
The operating system places the following lock states on database files when the files are opened by COBOL programs:
The shared-for-update lock state allows another user to open the file with shared-for-read or shared-for-update lock state.
For programs to share a database file, the file should be opened by the first program (the program with the highest call level in the stack) in a way that will allow subsequent programs to share the same file.
Another user can open the file but cannot use the same device.
When a database record is read by COBOL and the file is opened for I-O, a lock is placed on that record so that another program cannot update it.
If a logical file is based on more than one physical file, a lock is placed on one record in each physical file.
The single field will have the same name as the file, and will have the record length you specified in the create command.
The description includes information about the type of file, such as database or a device, and a description of each field and its attributes.
The description of the file to the operating system includes information about the type of file and the length of the records in the file.
If the same file is used by many programs, the fields can be defined once to the operating system, and then used by all the programs.
These specifications come from the external file description and from the OS/400 command you use to create the file.
At run time, a different library list or a file override command can be used so that a different file is accessed by the program.
Otherwise, a level check error will occur.
The record format specifications describe the fields in a record and the location of the fields in a record.
The fields are located in the record in the order specified in DDS.
The keys for a record format are specified in DDS.
In addition, DDS keywords can be used to:
See the DDS Reference for a complete list of the DDS keywords that are valid for a database file.
The following text describes some of the entries for this field reference file.
The field is edited when the record is written.
When DDS is not used to create the file, appropriate editing of the field in the COBOL program is also the user's responsibility.
Figure 7-4 shows the DDS for a logical file and Figure 7-5 shows the COBOL code generated.
Any field attributes specified in the DDS for the logical file override the attributes for the corresponding field in the physical file.
The definition of the fields in the physical file could refer to a field reference file.
When a field reference file is used, the same fields that are used in multiple record formats have to be defined only once in the field reference file.
For more information on a field reference file, see the Database Guide.
They do not make use of any DDS source statements for the file.
Library-name is optional.
If it is not specified, the current job library list is used as the default value.
The generated DDS entries represent the record format defined in the file.
If the file is a database file, a single I-O format is generated.
If I-O is specified, the generated data description entries contain either:
Database files never have indicators.
The record key entries that may appear in the table and the table heading are listed below.
The Indicator attribute specifies whether or not data description entries are generated for indicators.
If the Indicator attribute is specified, data description entries are generated for indicators, but not for data fields.
The data description entries that are generated are determined by which one of the usage attributes (I, O, or I-O) is specified or assumed in the COPY statement.
The fields can contain floating-point values set outside of COBOL.
No attempt must be made to use floating-point data for processing in the COBOL program.
This will give the floating-point fields in the record a value of zero.
For example: + 2.
Records are added only to the end of the file.
All record types in a file do not have to have the same key fields.
The key for a file is determined by the valid keys for the record types in that file.
If all record types in the file do not have the same key fields, the key for the file consists of the key fields common to all record types.
For example, a file has three record types and the key fields are defined as follows:
The default on the create file command is to request level checking.
The file must be created on the system before the program can run.
Use one of the Create File commands.
See the CL Reference for the commands.
DDS can be used with the Create File commands.
Specify a key in DDS when the file is created.
The record key in COBOL must match the key defined when the file was created.
For a complete description of these operations, see the COBOL/400 Reference.
Editing of field values is easily defined.
As a result, subsequent fields in the same format are printed on a new line.
All database files are created by OS/400 Create File commands.
See the Database Guide for a description of the Create File commands for database files.
The following table lists these characteristics and what controls them:
The DDS for the file specifies the fields to be used as the key field.
This keyword specifies that the keys defined in DDS for each record format are to be used for accessing the file.
They can be defined at different positions within the record format.
A generic START statement allows the use of a partial key.
For information on the use of format selector programs, refer to the Database Guide.
See the Database Guide for more information on logical file processing.
For a program-defined key field:
The key fields can begin at different positions in each record format.
See the "ASSIGN Clause" section of the COBOL/400 Reference for more information.
The file must be a physical file or a logical file where each member of the logical file is based on only one physical file member.
All physical database files that are opened for output are cleared.
The default format name of the file is the first format name defined in the file.
F1 A physical file opened for output is cleared.
(A locked record can only be modified within the same job and through the same physical or logical file.)
With a high lock level (*ALL), you cannot read locked records in a database file.
You can create a separate record to store data that may be useful should it become necessary to restart a job.
For more information about action taken by the system, see the Communications User's Guide.
Figure 7-25 gives an example of an error recovery procedure.
The main program is the first program in the run unit.
A run unit starts with the first COBOL program in the program stack and includes all programs (of any type) that are below it in the program stack.
Control returns to the (non-COBOL) program that called the main program.
Example of a Single Run Unit 1 No operation is processed because the statement is processed in a main program.
For all programs in the run unit, open files are closed.
Control returns to the program that is at call level n-1.
Example of Multiple Run Units 1 No operation is processed because the statement is processed in a main program.
Processing continues with the next statement in the main program.
All open files in run unit B are closed.
The local data area can be used to pass any desired information between programs in a job.
The system automatically creates a local data area for each job.
The local data area is defined outside the COBOL program as an area of 1024 bytes.
There is only one local data area associated with each job.
There is not a local data area for each work station.
See the COBOL/400 Reference for detailed syntax information.
A file cannot be received as a parameter in a COBOL program.
It does free the storage that contains information about the file.
The program can no longer use the file.
This can cause additional system storage to be used.
Two commands are provided to control the run-time switch.
To set the run-time switch on, enter the command:
You see the following screen:
If you press F24, the function keys shown at the bottom of the screen will change as shown below.
If you press F24 again, the following function keys are shown on the screen:
If you press F24 a third time, the function keys that were initially displayed will be shown again.
See "Run-Time Switch" for examples of how the function keys shown at the bottom of the screen change when you press F24.
The default for the run-time switch is off.
At the end of the run unit, all run-time switches that are on are set off.
Run-time switches for up to 15 programs can be on at once.
Following is an explanation of the notation used within the table:
This appendix provides a general description of messages that IBM supplies with the COBOL/400 licensed program.
In an interactive environment, messages are displayed on the work station screen.
The messages can also appear on request, as a result of a display command or an option on a menu.
The message text for CPF4101 follows:
The COBOL/400 messages listing gives the message identifier, severity, text, usually the location of the error, and the messages summary.
Message numbers are assigned as follows:
The COBOL/400 licensed program provides the following message severity levels:
Some manual action is required, such as entering a reply, changing printer forms, or replacing diskettes.
The OS/400 message facility is used to produce all messages.
If an IBM-supplied message must be changed and replaced in its message file, call your service representative.
Changing the severity could cancel a job not previously canceled.
Reserved words - new reserved words have been added.
I/O status - new I/O status values have been added.
If the COPY statement appears in a comment-entry, it is considered part of the comment-entry.
Otherwise, a quotation mark (") is used.
For example: -A 1 B.
See the COBOL/400 Reference for information on rules for formatting COBOL system-names, reserved words, and user-defined words such as data names and file names.
Use the EBCDIC character set instead.
Ensure that both the data description of the key and the key position within the file match those specified when you created the file.
You can use class conditions and switch status conditions as described in the COBOL/400 Reference.
The input data, including shift control characters, replaces the existing contents of the identifier.
COBOL does not perform editing or error checking on the data.
Information received replaces the existing contents.
COBOL does not perform any editing or checking for errors.
It does not make sure that this data is valid.
The system can follow either the EBCDIC or a user-defined collating sequence.
You must include the shift control characters when you write the data into a device file.
You cannot replace a character string with a string of a different length.
See the following examples for more information on how to do this.
You can check the COUNT data items to determine whether each receiving field received any characters.
Order the table according to the chosen collating sequence.
Use the Format 2 COPY statement to copy fields defined in the data description specifications (DDS).
In those cases, the system prints an O in the comment table for keys.
The actual decimal point appears in printed reports and requires a position in storage.
The arrangement of data in order from the lowest value of the key field to the highest value of the key field.
Contrast with actual decimal point.
A unit of data that is moved into or out of computer storage.

A description of the user's database or device files that is entered into the system in a fixed form.
The description is then used to create files.
One of the four main parts of a COBOL program.
A user-defined word that names a data item.
The arrangement of data in order from the highest value of the key field to the lowest value of the key field.
The location in physical storage where a single digit is stored.
The amount of storage required may vary depending on the usage specified in the data description entry that defines the data item.
There are four double-byte character sets supported by the system:
A feature that allows you to call different programs using the CALL statement.
Data contained in a file for which the fields and the records are described outside of the program (such as with files created by DDS, IDDU, or the SQL/400 licensed program), that processes the file.
A file in which the records and fields are described to the system when the file is created, and used by the program when the file is processed.
A reserved word that represents a numeric or character value, or a string of repeated values.
A group of records that are related.
A record associated with a file whose file description entry or sort-merge description entry requires that all records contain the same number of character positions.
A file that records the key and the position of each record in a separate part of the file called an index.
The file structure that identifies each record by the value of one or more keys within that record.
A field specified in a display file or database file that is reserved for information supplied by a user.

A user-defined word that identifies a COBOL source program.
A communication area for the entire COBOL run unit.
A set of one or more object programs that run as a set to solve a problem.
A unit of self-contained text.
A control character (hex 0F) that indicates the end of a string of double-byte characters.
One of the conditions chosen from the set of: relational condition class condition condition-name condition switch-status condition sign condition.

A user-defined word cannot be a reserved word.
A table element that is repeated a variable number of times.
Chapter 3 describes group jobs (which allow you to start many interactive jobs at one work station) and Attention key handling programs.
Chapter 5 gives examples of changing work management objects.
This includes information on how to create jobs and output queues.
It also includes information for all users about resource security.
It also contains examples of communications programs and describes return codes.
Device emulation is available for both displays and printers.
When the Operating System/400 (OS/400) licensed program is installed, it includes a work management environment that supports interactive, batch, and communications work, and spool processing.
These concepts and objects are described in more detail later in this chapter.
A batch job is started when the job is selected from the job queue.
A job started by a communications program start request from another machine is a communications batch job.
Job queues are not used when starting a communications batch job.
For output spooling, the system places output records produced by a program in a spooled output file.
One subsystem, called a controlling subsystem, is automatically started during the initial program load (IPL).
To use the system, each user must sign on with their user profile name.
The numbers refer to descriptions following the figure.
Network attributes apply to a network of systems, not just a single system.
Examples of system values are date, time, name of the controlling subsystem description, and maximum activity level of the system.
You can change these values to change system operation.
The run-time characteristics of a subsystem are defined in an object called a subsystem description.
It defines what jobs can run within a subsystem and how they can be run.
The subsystem takes on the simple name of the subsystem description.
You can use a subsystem description supplied with your system (with or without making changes to it), or you can create your own subsystem descriptions.)
When a job is started, the correct routing entry is selected by means of routing data.
In addition, a routing entry refers to another object called a class that contains parameters specifying the run-time environment for the routing step.
Any or all types of work entries can be specified in a single subsystem description.
A work station entry specifies one or a group of work stations from which interactive jobs can be started.
An interactive job starts when a work station user signs on, and ends when the user signs off.
Each job queue entry specifies one of the job queues from which the subsystem can select batch jobs.
A communications entry specifies one or a group of communications device descriptions by name or type, or a remote location name from which communicating batch jobs may be started.
For more information on communications functions, see the Communications User's Guide.
The program on the system which is to be started from another system is specified in a routing entry or in the routing data for the job.
Once the job is started, it is considered to be a batch job for accounting and identification purposes.
Figure 1-2 shows the relationship of the parts of a subsystem description in starting a routing step.
For interactive jobs, routing data comes from the job description.
The comparison value specifies data that is compared with routing data to determine which routing entry to use.
The routing data is compared with the comparison value of each routing entry in sequence number order until a match is found.
When a routing entry is found with a comparison value that matches the routing data, a routing step is started and the program specified in the routing entry is called.
The running control values in the class associated with the routing entry are used for the routing step, and the routing step runs in the storage pool specified in the routing entry.
More than one job in a subsystem can run in the same storage pool.
(All the subsystems supplied by IBM share the base storage pool.)
A storage pool does not have to be large enough to contain your programs.
The activity level of a storage pool is the number of jobs that can run at the same time in a storage pool.
During this delay, which is usually short, another job can run.
A subsystem must be active before work can be done in it.
During an IPL, a controlling subsystem is also started.
This controlling subsystem controls the console.
See the section on IBM-supplied objects in the System Reference Summary for a detailed description of these objects.
You can continue to use these objects or you can create your own.
All subsystem descriptions are shipped with *USE authority given to all users of the system.
This means that any user profile can run a job in any of the subsystems defined by the shipped subsystem descriptions.
However, anyone changing a subsystem description must be running under a user profile with *CHANGE authority for the subsystem description.
The user profiles shipped with the system are designed for the various types of system users.
For example, normal programmer functions are authorized to the QPGMR user profile; security officer functions are authorized to the QSECOFR user profile; and system operator functions are authorized to the QSYSOPR user profile.
The user profile associated with a job determines what system functions can be done by that job.
It is called during the running of most jobs that run on the system as it is shipped.
An initial program can be specified in a user profile.
The section on IBM-supplied objects in the System Reference Summary has complete descriptions of the shipped objects.
The console is the only work station that can be used during an attended IPL.
Therefore, if you assign another subsystem as the controlling subsystem, you must have a work station entry for the console in that subsystem description.
The default is to perform automatic configuration.
If you do not want the system to do this for you, enter the following command:
Specifies the name of the controlling subsystem description.
This is used to automatically start the controlling subsystem during every IPL.
You can change this to specify a different subsystem description, and it will be used on the next IPL.
Specifies what type of device names are to be assigned whenever the system automatically creates device descriptions.
The default is to use names like DSP01 for work stations and PRT01 for printers.
If you want to have names like W1 for work stations and P1 for printers, enter the following command:
Specifies how IPL is to occur.
The default is to not require passwords or authority.
Specifies whether users by default are to run in a special environment.
The default is to not run in a special environment.
This is the controlling subsystem.
It supports interactive, batch, and communications jobs.
It only supports signing on at the console.
This supports all interactive jobs (except at the console).
This supports all batch jobs.
Many of these cannot be changed while the subsystem is active.
The system default does not require a password.
The next few pages describe how work management uses the objects previously discussed from the time a subsystem is started to when the Main Menu is shown.
Figure 1-5 shows what normally occurs when a programmer signs on to the system as shipped.
The Main Menu appears because the programmer does not have an initial program.
The programmer can then specify commands or options from the menu to request functions of the system.
For interactive jobs, the job name is the same as the name of the work station you signed on to.
For batch jobs you can specify your own job name.
The job name can be up to 10 characters long.
For batch jobs you can specify the user profile under which the batch job is to run.
The job number is always 6 numeric digits.
For example you could specify the following:
Figure 1-7 shows the subsequent activity leading up to starting a routing step and displaying the Main Menu for a user profile specifying an initial program.
When a match is made, the program specified in the routing entry is called and the routing step is started.
Note the general description in the bottom portion of the figure.
A subsystem description can specify the maximum number of jobs (batch or interactive) that can be processed at the same time.
The number of jobs that can be active from any job queue can be specified in the job queue entry.
More than one subsystem description can refer to the same job queue, but only one active subsystem at a time can use the job queue as a source of batch jobs.
That is, the routing data is compared with the routing entries in the subsystem description.
For each job in the input stream, an entry is placed on a job queue.
The default of the command is to submit the job to run with the current user's user profile and some of the same job attributes.
If no job description is specified, the job description specified in your user profile is used.
A batch job on any job queue can be moved to a different queue.
See the section on IBM-supplied objects in the System Reference Summary, for a description of the spooling job descriptions.
The order (from highest to lowest) of detail is: device name entry, remote location name entry, device type entry.
Each mode on each device is allocated to a subsystem.
This chapter describes the work management objects (subsystem descriptions, job descriptions, and classes) and how they operate.
It also describes what objects are shipped with the system.
Examples and considerations of job starting and routing, and examples of creating your own subsystems are also described.
A subsystem description consists of three parts:
You add work entries to the subsystem description using the following commands:
To change or remove a specific type of work entry, or to change or remove routing entries, you use the following commands:
IBM-supplied subsystem descriptions are changed for controlling double-byte character set devices.
You do not need to change any subsystem descriptions.
No user jobs run in this storage pool.
This storage pool can be shared between subsystems.
A storage pool that runs interactive jobs.
This storage pool is defined if the initial program load (IPL) performance adjustment is set on.
There is a special type of job, called a subsystem monitor job, that controls all the activity in a subsystem.
It is the first job started when the subsystem starts, and the last to end when the subsystem is ending.
Storage for the subsystem monitor comes from pool 1 of the subsystem, but does not count toward an activity level.
The shipped default causes the storage for the subsystem monitor to come from the base storage pool.
For example, if, in the previous example, there was only 700K available, 300K would have been allocated to the first storage pool and 400K would have been allocated to the second storage pool.
You can specify an activity level for a storage pool.
For example, if a running job is waiting for a response from a work station, it gives up its activity level and the activity level is no longer at its maximum.
The job is automatically started each time the subsystem is started.
Jobs to be processed are taken from the specified job queue.
The job is processed when the subsystem receives a communications program start request from a remote system.
You can specify the following in these work entries (that are part of the subsystem description).
Parameter names are given in parentheses.
Set up the work station entries for the subsystems so that multiple subsystems are not using the same work stations.
When a user signs on to a device, his job runs in the subsystem that had the Sign On display displayed on the device.
The user's job continues to run in the first subsystem.
When the user signs off, the device remains allocated to the subsystem used when he signed on, and the Sign On display is displayed.
The name of the subsystem that currently has a work station allocated appears in the upper right corner of the Sign On display.
This field can be changed to function as an input/output buffer so the data specified on this portion of the display will be available to application programs when the interactive job is started.
The new fields must follow all other fields in the display file.
The length must total 128.
You can use more than 256 devices but you cannot specify more than 256 on this parameter.
For the best performance, you should specify no less than the maximum number of devices you want sign-on displays on (up to the maximum of 256).
You should use a test version of a subsystem to verify that the display is valid before attempting to change the controlling subsystem.
The data specified on the user portion of the Sign On display will be sent as replacement data in the CPF1124 message for interactive jobs.
This data starts in byte 133 of the replacement text.
The following program will retrieve the data:
A routing entry defines how a job is to be started.
When you add a routing entry to a subsystem description, you assign a sequence number to the entry.
This sequence number tells the subsystem the order in which routing entries are to be searched for a routing data match.
For example, you have a subsystem description containing the following five routing entries:
The routing entries are searched in sequence number order.
If the routing data is 'A', the search ends with routing entry.
When you define routing entries, they must be ordered from the most specific to the most general.
The following example shows a correct and incorrect way to define routing entries:
In the incorrect example, it is no longer possible to match routing entry 20 because any routing data that matches the comparison value for routing entry 20 matches the routing entry 10 first.
When a routing entry is changed or added to a subsystem description with a comparison value that causes this situation, the system sends a diagnostic message identifying the situation.
The program named in the routing entry is given control when the routing step for the job is started.
The default for the user profile the job is to use.
The job queue on which the job is to be placed (batch job only).
Priority of the job on the job queue (batch job only).
Data used to determine which routing entry to use for the job.
Data to be put on the job message queue.
The user part of the initial library list for the job.
The default printer device on which the spooled output files made by the job are to be printed.
The default output queue on which the spooled output files made by the job are to be placed.
This defaults to the output queue associated with the printer device.
Displays the contents of a job description.
For example, if you specified:
Also, if this type of job description is used on a work station entry, it allows anyone to sign on as that user just by pressing the Enter key.
It contains parameters to control the run-time environment of a job.
The maximum amount of temporary auxiliary storage (specified in K bytes) a job can use before it is ended by the system.
You can create your own classes.
If you change the attributes for a job that is on a job queue, the changes take effect when the job becomes active.
Jobs (work) on the job queue are then selected to run.
Running jobs that are to produce printed output place entries on an output queue (waiting line) to be printed.
This process is called spooling.
A subsystem selects jobs from a job queue for running.
Entries for the spooled output files made by jobs are placed on an output queue.
A writer selects the output from the queue for writing to an output device.
Both the job queue name and the default output queue name for a job are specified in the job description for the job.
Job queue entries in a subsystem description specify which job queues a subsystem is to receive jobs from.
Do not perform any syntax checking of the jobs in the input stream.
(Once the command has been specified, you can continue with other work.)
For a detailed description of these commands, see the CL Reference.
The CMD parameter gives the CL command that will run in the job.
The system automatically creates an output queue when you create a printer device (the same name is used).
The following shows what work management information is specified in the various work management objects.
Command names and parameter names are used to identify the information and where it is specified.
This is called routing the job.
Each time that a job causes a subsystem to search the routing table (for any reason) is called a routing step.
Most jobs will only have one routing step, but it is possible for some jobs to have many routing steps.
Pressing F3 from the highest level of the command entry display (only valid for interactive jobs.)
Each routing step in a started job operates under the control of the program called at the start of the routing step.
The routing data received by the system determines the routing entry in which the program name can be found.
If you define your own routing programs, you should consider running a user's initial program and/or menu.
The display has a 30-second time-out; therefore, if the work station user does not press a valid key (Enter, Help, or a valid function key) in the time-out period, the display is removed when the time ends.
The initial program specified in the user profile is called.
The user is placed in System/36 environment if specified in the user profile.
Your programs can be directly called to control the routing steps for interactive jobs.
You may want to provide functions such as an initial program and initial menu also.
After you have determined which program controls the routing step, you must determine if routing is to be based on the work station from which the job was started, or on the user (user profile) who signed on.
When an initial program is called, it cannot receive parameter values.
It can be used as the controlling program for the job.
The initial menu is not displayed.
The user can only request those functions available through the initial program.
For example, a menu could be displayed with specific application options.
The end user could only perform the functions on the menu.
One of the options would normally be sign off.
A job log is produced for the job.
No job log is produced.
If there is no library specified on the program start request, the subsystem library list is used to find the program.
The input stream in the database file was:
The called program may contain commands (including other CALL commands) to do the functions of an application.
You can submit a batch job in a running job (for example, submit a job from a display work station.)
A job name can be specified, but if it is not, it is assumed to be the same as the simple job description name.
For example, the system operator can submit a job that saves a database file.
The following example shows how to submit a batch program with a fixed parameter.
The following example shows how to submit a program with character-type parameter values that are passed to a CL program.
A display file is used to prompt the user.
The program prompts for the parameters and receives data from the display file.
You must also specify blanks, apostrophes, and parentheses that are to be included in the parameter to be passed.
If the following information was specified on the prompt:
The work station user should key in all alphabetic data (no leading digits) for this field.
It is received as a character variable in the CL program, and no special processing is required for the data.
The work station user could start with a digit when typing in the DEPT field (for example, 43T).
This is the wrong data type; the DEPT parameter must be character data.
However, in the CL program, you must specify four apostrophes.
The character variable must be long enough to contain this data.
(All numeric variables passed in from a processing program are passed as 15 5.)
If an error is detected during routing step starting, the routing step is started only to produce a job log and perform clean-up functions.
The routing step started message is still sent and gives the user the name of the subsystem in which the routing step failure occurred.
Either an interactive job or a batch job can be transferred to another subsystem.
However, to transfer a job, the user profile for the job must have *READ authority for the job queue and *USE authority for the subsystem description of the subsystem being transferred to.
When an interactive job is placed on a job queue, it is given the highest job queue priority to minimize any delay.
A batch job can transfer itself to another job queue.
In this case, the job queue need not be associated with an active subsystem, and it is placed on the job queue with its current job priority.
During the IPL, the system removes the job from the job queue and produces its job log.
This includes having the same job name and a single job log made for the job.
The routing program is often used only once per job.
If a call is from a user-written routing program, the return occurs as normal to the next instruction.
A job queue entry.
A work station entry.
Active jobs do not include jobs that are on a job queue waiting to be started, or jobs that have completed processing but are waiting for a spooled file to be printed.
These jobs are all active jobs.
For the storage pool activity level, the number of jobs running (or active jobs) refers to the number of jobs that have an activity level; that is, the jobs are actually running or they may be waiting for a disk I/O operation.
The following examples show the relationship of some of the activity controls.
The system activity level is assumed to be 100.
The activity level of the base storage pool is 3.
However, all the jobs are started.
Therefore, jobs will be processed in job priority one at a time off the job queue.
A change to this value takes effect at the next IPL unless the change is made by selecting "Define or change system at IPL menu" on the IPL options display during the IPL.
In that case, the change takes effect during the current IPL.
A subsystem description that does not contain a work station entry for the console cannot be started as a controlling subsystem.
To have an alternative source of controlling input, the subsystem description for the controlling subsystem should have an entry for another work station.
Then, if the subsystem description for the controlling subsystem contains a work station entry for another work station, that work station can be used.
All work stations that are not allocated by subsystems or jobs have test request processed by the controlling subsystem.
In the following example, objects are created for a subsystem in which interactive work is to be processed.
The subsystem description ORDER is created and placed in library QGPL.
When the subsystem ORDER is started, one storage pool with a size of 500K bytes is allocated.
The subsystem monitor programs called to handle the jobs in the subsystem ORDER use storage from pool 1, which is the shared base storage pool, but use machine pool activity level.
When the subsystem ORDER is started, DSP01 and DSP02 are allocated to ORDER.
The following command should be specified for any subsystem that has work station entries.
This pool is defined as the base storage pool.
In addition, there are commands to display the status of activities in the system.
You can use the following commands to monitor activity in the system:
Every job in the system operates under a job description.
This controls the various attributes of a job.
The USER parameter controls the name of the user profile that will be assigned to the job.
There are several considerations to this parameter.
The default is to use the job description specified in the user profile.
(No authority is needed to the actual user profile.)
Frequently, a specific name in the job description is required in order to let users submit work for a specific user profile.
This job description is created normally (the public is given *CHANGE authority).
It is valid to use these commands and name a job description that is not in existence at the time the command is entered.
However, the job description name and library are set at that time.
The user specified on the job description is ignored.
(If the job descriptions with specific names have public authority, then anyone can use them.)
This chapter describes how to start many interactive jobs at one work station using group job support.
How to start, handle, and end group jobs is described along with a sample application for group jobs.
This chapter also describes Attention key handling programs which allow you to go quickly from one group job to another.
When a request is repeated, the function can be called with all files open and the proper display displayed.
Group jobs are unique to a user (they are not shared by multiple users).
There is a 512-byte group data area that can be used to pass data between one group job and another.
(At this point the group has only one group job.)
Each group job is unique for a user.
Two different users do not share the same group job.
When a job is designated as a group job, it then has the capability to call a new group job.
To allow group jobs to communicate with each other, a special 512-byte data area called a group data area is automatically created when a job becomes a group job.
The use of group jobs does not require an Attention key menu approach as described in this section.
The following shows the relationship of group jobs to a secondary interactive job.
The same user profile and environment is used.
Up to 16 group jobs can exist at any one time.
It is possible to use group jobs together with system request for a total of 32 group jobs available for a single user.
However, these 32 jobs are in two separate groups, each group having its own group data area and other group attributes.
This can interrupt a logical sequence of events.
For example, records may be left locked.
The System Request function is always available if the work station user has authority to it.
Press the System Request key and start a secondary interactive job.
Use the group job approach as shown in the following example:
The menu can contain any options, but in this example, the options are the same as those shown on the Main Menu.
The attention handling menu allows him to select any of the functions in any sequence.
Note that the work station user cannot start two group jobs with the same group job name.
If the job specified a group job name that is already active, control is passed to that job (no new group job is started) and the initial group program parameter is ignored.
It is also possible to have several group jobs (having unique names) all doing the same function.
The Attention key cannot be pressed until the program requests input from the work station.
When the Attention key is pressed, the system saves the current display.
The complete listing for this example is shown later in this chapter.
When the Attention key is pressed, the running job is interrupted, the display is saved, and the Attention key handling program is called.
No parameters are passed to the Attention key handling program when it is called.
You may also specify an Attention key handling program in the user profile.
Program A continues to be the Attention key handling program until step 3.
Pressing the Attention key causes these programs to be interrupted at any point by the Attention key handling program.
A BASIC session is in progress, or a BASIC program is called.
After the BASIC program ends, your Attention key handling program takes effect again.
Therefore, the interrupted program is not protected by any locks it held.
Attention key handling programs do not have the authority adopted by the program that was in progress before the Attention key was pressed.
This could cause unexpected results.
The Attention key handling program allows only a fixed set of options.
The work station user determines the options.
This is the method used in the example earlier in this chapter.
In that example, the user can only select from the options on the menu.
A menu is displayed to the work station user with the following options:
Because this program will display a menu, it is called an Attention key menu program.
The system determines if the group job already exists.
If it does not, the group job is started and the initial group program is used.
The system determines if the group job is already active; if it is not, the system starts the group job and calls the initial program.
This provides a display of the current group jobs and allows the work station user to transfer to any group job.
This approach can be useful for programmers because it allows them to call several group jobs and to specify what command should be run.
For example, assume that the work station user specifies the following commands or runs them as part of a standard setup program:
For example, assume the work station user specified the command:
The work station user can now use the programmer menu.
If the Attention key is pressed again, the display would show:
On this display, the jobs are shown in the order they were called.
If a user written menu is displayed, an input field on the menu for the group job name could also be considered.
This would display all the standard programs and allow the user to add group jobs.
The programmer can add additional group jobs if necessary.
In the following example, the programmer has the following standard group jobs:
In this approach, each programmer has a unique initial program.
The group job data area is used to pass the command to be run.
From this display, the programmer can change and add additional group jobs.
To add another standard group job requires only two additional commands be added to the initial program and no changes to the other programs.
The command is not run immediately, but is stored in a variable in the program.
The program returns to the previous group job.
The user will transfer to the STRWP1 group job.
This allows the programmer to transfer to an existing group job or start a new group job.
Pressing the Exit key does not end the SRTWP1 group job.
The active group job is the first one in the list.
The program starts by trying to access the name of the second group job (starts in position 67) and if it is not blank, it ended the group job.
In all previous examples, the work station user was allowed to go to any function from any other function.
An alternative is to have the work station user always return to the main program.
For example, assume that the user may have a group job where there is a complex update involved and you want to be sure the job is ended normally.
That is, when the switch is set on, the group jobs function should be ended.
This will end the group job and return control to the previous active group job.
Use job queues to do long-running functions in a batch environment.
Add more job queues.
Create your own interactive or batch subsystems.
If an initial program is specified, that program is called.
If control returns from the initial program, a check is made for an initial menu.
If one is specified in the user profile, it is displayed.
You can specify an initial program or an initial menu on the Sign On display if your user profile allows this.
You can use request data in a job description to call a program.
In this case, if the work station user has an initial program associated with his user profile, that initial program is called.
However, if there is no initial program associated with the user profile, the request data is processed and the specified program is called.
To specify an initial program in a user profile, you use the Create User Profile (CRTUSRPRF) command:
You can call them with your own program.
This program can display a menu that allows work station users to select the application they want to run.
If you do not end the initial program, the program continues to run until the subsystem is ended or the job is ended.
The initial menu will continue to be displayed until you sign off.
When you use routing data to determine a controlling program for a work station, you need to create a job description that specifies the routing data, add a work station entry to the subsystem description, and add a routing entry to the subsystem description.
(In order to change the subsystem description, the subsystem must be inactive.)
If someone signs on at work station DSP03 with user name DSP03USER, the program DSP03MENU is called.
If DSP03USER is used to sign on at another work station that does not have a special work station entry set up, the initial menu is displayed.
You can also allow access to the System Request menu, but prevent the use of certain commands.
You may want to create a special output queue for the programmer so his spooled output is always sent to that queue.
For interactive jobs, you can change the initial program for the programmer so the new initial program specifies this output queue:
Another alternative is to assign a unique job description to the user profile that contains the desired parameters.
A second job queue can be created and added to the subsystem.
To create the job queue, enter the following command:
(This command can be issued at any time and will take effect immediately.)
Another alternative is to send all the completion messages to a user message queue.
The following command changes the QSYSOPR message queue:
The subsystem description and job queue could be defined with the following commands:
The CL program could be:
The job queue entry shown in the previous example should be changed to meet your requirements.
If you created your own controlling subsystem, you should refer to the job queue for that subsystem.
The system operator can submit the commands from the system operator menu.
You may want to control a group of work stations separately.
For example, if you have a group of work station users who are using the same application, you may want that group of users to sign off to perform some special application function or to send them a message.
Create a command or a CL program that can be used to send a message to a group of work stations.
However, this approach does not assist in controlling sign-on or sign-off.
You may want to create a command for this function to allow a simple means of running this program.
If the Refresh key is pressed, the display will then show all jobs that are using more than 2\%{} of the processing unit resource since the command was run.
Create a job description to be used for the double-byte devices.
However, the job description has different routing data.
Create a copy of the subsystem description.
Change the work station entry for the 5555 Display to specify the job description you just created.
Add a routing entry that matches the routing data of the double-byte job description.
When the default printer file is double-byte, the system properly prints double-byte output printed as a result of pressing the Print key.
Some applications require that functions be performed at a specified time.
This is referred to as time-dependent scheduling.
Although the system does not support this type of function directly, existing functions can be combined to perform time-dependent scheduling.
A single request-processing job must be active at all times to handle all of the time-dependent requests sent by other jobs.
It is intended for personal rather than program action.
This sample command would have the following parameters:
Up to 100 characters can be sent.
This allows users to have a single command to do both the delayed time and immediate function.
It appears as the following message:
If you are sending messages that contain apostrophes, a special form may be required.
The job is not run at the requested time; rather it is released at that time.
All held jobs appear last on the job queue.
If it is critical to perform certain functions at the requested time, then a unique job queue could be created to handle these requests.
Up to 256 bytes may be entered.
This approach allows users to have a single command to do both the delayed time and immediate function.
The default is the job description name.
The request-processing job runs as an interactive job for most of its functions; you may choose to place it in the interactive subsystem.
If the job is placed in a batch subsystem, you will want to be sure that the maximum number of jobs specified will allow the request-processing job as well as your other jobs to be started.
See "Security Considerations" in topic 5.15.4 later in this chapter about the required *JOBCTL special value.
When the program is started, it clears out any requests that have been run from the last time the program was started.
If this occurs, these requests are run immediately.
There are no parameters for this command and it is entered as:
To release another user's job, the request-processing job must be started by a user who has special authority *JOBCTL.
As in a normal environment, you may wish to control who can send messages to certain user-created message queues.
The sample objects should be placed in a library such as QGPL where all users can access them by use of their library list.
If QGPL is not used, you will need to change where you specifically refer to QGPL in the sample code.
Adding a record to a database file will not cause the request-processing program to activate.
After it is run, it is updated with an X and becomes the last record in the access path.
If a value is entered, it is used as a specific date.
This has the effect of adding the number of days requested.
The actual date to be used is checked to see if it is valid.
If the day requested is the current day, the time must be equal to or greater than the current time.
If it is not in the file, it is added.
If none occurs, it receives the low level messages and looks for CPF1221.
You may want to change this command to allow for a specific time or a delay time value.
If the return code is 2, no request is due.
This means the job is still on the system but is either active or on the output queue.
In either case, a message is sent to QSYSOPR.
You may wish to add some additional error handling.
This will keep the program active and still allow problem analysis.
If the action code is 2, the program ends.
Any record that has been added with a lower key (an earlier time) is now the first record and will be read first.
If no request is due that day, the program returns a value to wait until the end of the day.
This chapter will help you understand some of the work management parameters that affect performance and how to set up and analyze your system.
With the proper setting of the work management parameters, you can make the best use of each resource.
Jobs running in the system will be in any of the three states shown below:
If a job is waiting, it means that the job needs a resource that is not available.
When a job is waiting for a resource, it may wait in main storage or it may be removed from main storage until the resource is available.
Some of these objects used by jobs are:
If they are not in main storage, they must be read into main storage from their locations on disk (auxiliary) storage.
The object is either shared by jobs or is unique to a specific job.
When an object is shared by jobs, only one copy of the object exists.
However, the variables and data in the application will not have the same values for all jobs using the application.
The system assigns main storage to the job that is currently active.
When a job attempts to run, there must be space for the job in main storage.
Before a job can become active, there must be an available activity level.
If an activity level is available, the job becomes active and begins processing in main storage.
This is called a first-in, first-out priority queue.
Therefore, you want jobs holding locks on objects to use them and make them available for other jobs to use.
However, this chapter discusses only the system commands.
You can either increase or decrease the pool size or the activity level.
This may be caused by a batch job accessing data.
If you observe this activity, do not change the disk configuration.
This section describes some of the steps taken to initially configure the system pool sizes and activity levels.
Otherwise, the values will be reset at the next IPL.
When setting the initial machine pool size, use the following:
S = M + J + L + F where:
In order to get a value for this part of the system, you can use the table below.
For each line, protocol, line type, and controller, the machine pool must include some additional main storage.
Figure 6-5 is given as a simple guide to the additional storage required.
However, you are able to do a better job because you know the communications configuration of the system.
If you plan to use any of the functions shown in Figure 6-6 you should add the appropriate amount of main storage to the machine pool.
Figure 6-8 assumes that interactive work is running at the same time as batch jobs.
Once you have set your initial pool sizes and activity levels, you should begin to observe your system performance.
Once you have reached the values shown earlier as good, you can stop.
As a result, the jobs must wait for an activity level before they can run.
Be certain to measure and compare each change so that you can identify the best activity level.
The second situation indicates that the activity level may be set right, but the pool size is too small.
In the last situation, the activity level is probably set too high.
In this case, too many jobs are allowed into the pool at the same time.
Once again, it is necessary to measure and observe performance after each change.
These operations may not always be necessary.
The activity level should be set equal to the number of jobs running at the same time.
Often, the functions performed by these users are different from the functions used by all other users.
Each batch job may use objects that are different from the objects used by other batch jobs in the same pool.
Each pool should have an activity level of one and only one active job.
These cases are not common.
This data includes internal system trace data from the vertical microcode trace table.
This section explains how to start and end the collection of performance data.
When the performance monitor batch job is started from the job queue, data collection begins.
If the trace table is cleared for any reason (running another system trace clears the trace table), the performance trace data is lost.
The internal trace table has a maximum size of 16M of storage.
The trace table can use up to 16M, but is not initially set to that value.
If the trace is not started, the size of the trace table is not changed.
The performance monitor then automatically turns off the trace.
Wait until the performance monitor ends and have the performance monitor dump the trace at that time (this is the default).
Do not dump the trace when the performance monitor ends.
Therefore, the performance monitor must retrieve the data every 5 minutes to ensure that there is no loss of data.
One of these events occurs when a job ends on the system.
While the performance monitor is active, it sends information messages to the system operator's message queue.
These messages notify the system operator when the status of the performance monitor changes or an error occurs.
Figure 7-1 lists the various fields in the configuration file entries.
L Resource name of the local work station controller.
The following terms are used in Figure 6-2, and are repeated for each group of jobs.
Number of database read operations.
Number of write operations.
Number of print lines.
Number of lines written by the program.
This number does not reflect what is actually printed.
Spooled files can be ended, or printed with multiple copies.
These do not include remote work station activity.

Local Work Station Response Time File Entries:
This chapter describes system values and network attributes by first giving a summary of the different system values divided by type and then detailed descriptions of the system values.
System values are not objects and cannot be passed as parameter values like CL variables.
If there is only one item in the list, you do not need apostrophes.
The second item, if specified, is ignored.
Apostrophes are necessary only when the library name or *LIBL is specified with the object name.
If the library name is not specified or *LIBL is specified for the library, the library list is used to locate the object, and the library where the object is found is stored in the system value.
When object names are specified for system values, the lowercase letters in the names are always changed to uppercase even when they are in apostrophes.
This means that you should not use lowercase letters in the names of objects or libraries that you may want to specify on any of the system values.
The following is a summary of the system values and the initial values shipped with the system.
'1' Means wait.)
If a list of values is specified as the new value, the list must be enclosed in apostrophes and separated by blanks.
If a numeric value or special character is specified for a character type system value, it must be enclosed in apostrophes.
If a numeric system value is specified by using a CL variable, the variable must be decimal.
A numeric value is not enclosed in apostrophes unless it is specified for a character type system value.
If a CL variable is used to specify the value for a character type system value, the CL variable must be character type and may be of any length.
Date and time system values must always be enclosed in apostrophes.
A change made to this value takes effect immediately.
When you specify the date in CL commands, you can specify only 2 digits for the year in the date format.
The system assigns the first 2 digits for the year (xx) based on the following rules:
The following table shows the various values provided by the CL character variable.
(Y = year; M = month; D = day.)
Previous end of system indicator.
You can refer to this value in user-written recovery programs.
You will have to manually configure any new local controllers or devices that you add to your system.
The system will automatically configure any new local controllers or devices that are added to your system.
Default character set and code page.
This system value specifies the character set and code page to be used when CHRID(*SYSVAL) is specified for the CL commands that create, change, or override display files, display device descriptions, and printer files.
This part identifies the character set to use.
This identifier must be in the range of 1 through 32,767.
This part identifies the code page to use.
For example, the value 101 would be retrieved as 0000000101.
The last 10 characters contain the code page identifier right-adjusted.
The possible recovery actions are:
Specifies the name of the display device that is the console.
You cannot change this system value.
The system changes this value when the console is varied on.
A change to this value takes effect at the next IPL unless the change is made on the IBM-supplied configuration menu during an IPL, in which case a change to this value takes effect immediately.
The subsystem you will be signed on to is displayed in the upper right corner of the sign-on prompt.
This is because the change takes effect immediately.
Do not wait for database recovery to complete.
A change to this value takes effect during the next IPL in unattended mode.
Specifies what naming convention is used when the system automatically creates device descriptions.
You can change, display, and retrieve this value.
The following shows an example of the normal naming convention and the S36 naming convention:
You can refer to this system value in an application program.
Date and time to automatically IPL the system.
Specifies a date and time when an automatic IPL should occur.
The second value is the time.
The seconds portion of the time value must be specified, but is ignored.
There is an indicator value for each form of IPL.
You can refer to this value in your recovery programs, but you cannot change it.
IPL occurred when requested from the operator panel.
Auto-IPL after power restored.
IPL occurred automatically when power was restored after a power failure.
Specifies the type of IPL performed when the system is powered on manually with the key in the normal position.
No displays are shown during an IPL.
The normal sign-on display is shown when the IPL is complete.
Specifies the language character set for the keyboard.
The existing values for system pool sizes and activity levels are used.
Be sure to do at least one IPL after your configuration is set.
Specifies the default printer for the system.
This value will take effect when a spooled file is opened.
If the specified device description exists, it must be a printer device description.
The initial value is PRT01.
A change to this value takes effect when a PWRDWNSYS command is entered.
Automatic IPL is allowed after power restored.
Specifies if the system should automatically IPL when utility power is restored after a power failure.
Specifies the system environment used as the default for all user profiles.
This value will not be saved in the user profile.
It will be checked at sign-on time.
The system serial number is also used to set the system name.
This program performs setup functions such as starting subsystems and printers.
This system value can only be changed by the security officer or a profile with security officer authority.
Releases the QS36MRT and QS36EVOKE job queues if they were held (these are used by the System/36 environment).
This system value is either set by the system at IPL time or by the user on the IPL Options display.
This value can only be displayed or retrieved.
A change to this value takes effect immediately.
You specify only the first item in the list.
The second item, if specified, will be ignored.
The first 10 characters would be what you specified.
The following examples show what the user could enter and how the value would be displayed:
Value *NOMAX *NOMAX Example 3 User types:
If the message queue is a work station message queue (or QSYSOPR), it must be in break or notify mode.
If the message queue is not a work station message queue, it must be allocated by a job.
A job log will be produced for the job.
System part of library list.
The list can contain as many as 15 names.
Apostrophes are necessary only when more than one library name is specified (for example, 'SYSLIB1 SYSLIB2').
The libraries in the system part are searched for an object before any libraries in the user part.
A change to this value takes effect immediately (when the next job starts).
Default for user part of library list.
Apostrophes are necessary only when more than one library name is specified.
The libraries in this part are searched for an object after the libraries in the system part and also after the product library and current library entries.
Initial number of active jobs for which auxiliary storage is to be allocated during IPL.
An active job is a job that has started running but not ended.
The amount of auxiliary storage allocated for each active job is approximately 110K.
The amount of storage allocated for each job is approximately 110K.
The next logical choice would be 8192.
The lower limit is 1024 bytes.
A change to this value takes effect for the next time an extension is needed.
Initial size of the job message queue.
Maximum initial size of the job message queue.
Initial size of the spooling control block for a job.
(There is one spooling control block for each job in the system.)
The allocated area is made up of standard control information plus a separate set of control information for each spooled file.
Initial number of jobs for which auxiliary storage is to be allocated during IPL.
The number of jobs is the number supported by the system at any one time, which includes the jobs on job queues, active jobs (including system jobs), and jobs having output on output queues.
Apostrophes are necessary only when more than one option is specified and each option must be separated by blanks.
The possible accounting level options are:
For more information on job accounting, see Chapter 9, "Using Job Accounting" in topic 9.0.
Maximum number of records for each version of the history log.
When a version is full (the maximum has been reached), a new version is created.
You can save the full (old) version on diskettes and then delete it.
The CL Reference has more information on formatting print text.
Maximum activity level of the base storage pool.
Storage not allocated to another storage pool remains in the base storage pool.
Maximum activity level of the system.
Size of the machine storage pool.
Automatic configuration of virtual devices for pass-through.
Maximum number of invalid sign-on attempts allowed.
Limit the use of certain characters in a password.
Maximum length of a password.
Remote sign-on control.
Network attributes are not objects and cannot be passed as parameter values like CL variables.
The system is shipped with certain network attributes.
Most of these are important only if your system is part of a communications network.
For more information about each network attribute, see the CL Reference, as well as the manuals listed in the figure.
To save network attributes with system values, use the Save System (SAVSYS) command.
For more information on using these commands, see the CL Reference.
You must take specific steps (described later in the section "Setting Up Job Accounting" in topic 9.11) to set up job accounting.
You may also assign accounting codes to user profiles or specific jobs.
With this command you can write the entries into a database file.
You must write application programs or use a utility such as the query utility to analyze the data.
Direct print (DP) journal entry:
Contains data about printer files made by a print writer (spooled).
Job accounting data available through the QHST messages is a subset of the method described here.
If multiple copies occurred, this is the sum of all copies.
Job 1 does not make any printer output, and no job log is made.
Job 2 does not make any spooled printer output and no job log is made.
A job may not use the same amount of resources each time it is run.
Therefore, high priority jobs use less system resource than low priority jobs.
Accounting codes are assigned to users or jobs.
You do not need any resource information other than that provided in the CPF1124 and CPF1164 messages, which are sent automatically to the QHST log.
You do not need print accounting information.
When a job is started, a job description is assigned to the job.
If the default of *USRPRF is used, the accounting code in the job's user profile is used.
If all work for a particular user is to be recorded under one accounting code, only user profiles need to be changed.
Each resource accounting journal entry contains information about the resources used while the previous accounting code was in effect.
For example, the following illustrates a job with two accounting segments:
However, if you are using print file accounting, the job log printed will be included in the printer file journal entries.
Each journal entry contains the standard prefix fields for any journal entry (for example, date, time, journal sequence number).
The job types recorded are the following:
The number of print lines does not reflect what is actually printed.
Spooled files can be canceled or printed with multiple copies.
The numbers recorded for communications I/O operations do not include remote work station activity.
The information provided is similar to that provided in the DP accounting journal data except that the spooled file name, spooled file number, output priority, form type, and total number of bytes of control information and print data sent to the printer are included.
You need to specify the name of the journal receivers you created in the previous step and any other options on the command.
The job trying to send the journal entry continues normally.
If the journal is allocated by another job, the journal entry is changed to message text and sent to the QHST log as message CPF1303.
Only a user with the *SECADM special authority is allowed to use the CRTUSRPRF and CHGUSRPRF commands.
This command is supplied with *CHANGE authority.
(Authority to create or change job descriptions is also required.)
Change the accounting code in his current job.
Change the accounting code of a job other than his own if he also has the *JOBCTL special authority.
You must decide what authorization should exist for the accounting journal and journal receiver.
If you need to access the information from the CPF1303 message you will need to create a high-level language program.
In order to define records that match the CPF1303 message you will need to include the following fields:
The CPF1164 message always consists of three records and the CPF1303 message always consists of four records.
The information contained in the standard journal prefix fields is not included in this message.
If the member exists, it is cleared before the records are written.
If the member does not exist, it is added.
This format defines the standard heading fields for each journal entry, but the job accounting data is defined as a single large field.
To avoid having to process the accounting data as a single large field, two field reference files are supplied to help you in processing the job accounting journal entries.
The DP entry for directly printed files contains some fields that are not used; these fields contain blanks.
This file can then be processed by the query utility or an high-level language program.
You would then use a program-described file to process the journal entries in a high-level language program.
Enter the following DDS to create a logical file to allow processing of both physical files.
This allows you to read a single file in accounting code order and print a report using a high-level language program:
Before an accounting code is placed in a user profile, you may want to ensure that the code is valid and that it is valid for a particular user.

Each part of an online book is called a topic.
Many of the ways in which you look at a book online are similar to how you might use a printed book.
An exact match, any case.
This matches your search request word for word, including uppercase and lowercase letters.
For example, you can move forward and backward just as you might turn pages in a printed book.
You can also move directly to the part of the book you want to view, such as the table of contents or a specific topic.
For information on using these file services, see "Copying, Printing, and Editing Topics" in topic.
You can also make changes to notes, share your notes with other users, and review notes that other users have written for a book.
When you copy or print a topic, you can choose to copy or print any of its notes.
Although each panel lets you do something different, some actions are common to all panels.
You open a book to view the contents of a single book.
You can open a book at any time.
In some cases, you can select an action by pressing a function key associated with your choice.
After you open a book, you can also request actions by entering commands instead of making selections on the panels.
While a pull-down is displayed, only the actions in the pull-down or on the action bar are available.
For example, if you select a pull-down and the action you want is not listed in it, you can select another pull-down on the action bar.
However, you cannot use function keys that do not appear in the pull-down, mark items listed on the panel, or select words in the text until the pull-down is removed.
While a window is displayed, only the actions in that window are available.
For example, you cannot select an action on the action bar or use function keys that do not appear in the window until the window is removed.
When a window is displayed, you can press or select only the function keys listed in that window, not the ones at the bottom of the panel.
"Setting the Function Keys" in topic 13.5 tells you which function keys you can change and how to change them.
The command area is displayed just above the function key area.
If the cursor is on the action bar or in the function key, command, or message area, pressing F7 and F8 moves a full panel of information backward or forward.
If there is no preceding window, you go to where the cursor was located when you selected the action (for example, the action bar, the command area, or the function key you pressed to select the action)
The following topic describes this action.
If the information does not fit on one panel, press the key you normally use to clear the screen and advance, or wait a few seconds to advance automatically.
It exists until you either close it or end the session.
A status line that shows whether a note exists in the topic, the number of lines in the topic, and your position in the book.
This information is above the command area at the bottom right corner of the panel.
If you select No or press F12, the session does not end.
You can select another action on the action bar.
The Help pull-down, shown in Figure 14 in topic 2.1, appears.
Keys help shows you the current function key settings.
If you press F1 while a pull-down or window is displayed, you go to the section of the help book that describes the available actions.
If you press F1 while a message is displayed, you see an explanation of it.
Select Extended help in the Help pull-down.
For example, to open the help book to the topic that best discusses copying topics, enter help copy topics.
See "HELP - Getting Help" in topic A.3.15 for examples of using the HELP command.
To close the help book, press F.
However, not all pull-down actions are available.
In the Services pull-down, you cannot select Edit source to change the text of the help book.
When you use the Options pull-down to change the way the help book is displayed, the changes are made only for the current session.
For details on using a book profile, see "Using Profiles" in topic.
Figure 16 in topic 2.3 is an example of the Help for function keys window.
Press F1 while you are looking at the command help window to get a detailed explanation of the command and its options.
The message help explains the reason for the message and tells you what actions to take.

Press F6 to deselect the current book and display information about the next book you marked.
If no table of contents exists, you see the first topic in the book.
If you specify a document number, you must identify an existing book that is shared in the public library.
The Close book window, shown in Figure 33 in topic 5.3, is displayed.
You can also select this action by pressing F.
If you opened the book directly from CMS, the session ends and you return to CMS.
When you select a topic in the list, you are positioned at the first search match it contains.
When you select a book in the list, you can either open the book or view a list of the topics with search matches.
You see a pull-down in which you can choose to set up a new search request, or work with the results of the last search you entered.
To search the book you are currently viewing, select Search on the action bar.
After entering a search request, you see a list of all the topics in the book that contain search matches.
You can work with the matches immediately or, by selecting List all topics with matches in the Search pull-down, return to them at a later time.
You can work with the results of a search until you enter another search request.
Figure 35 in topic 6.2 is an example of the Search pull-down in a book.
Figure 36 in topic 6.3 is an example of the Set up search window you see in a book.
The following topics show you how to use special characters and function keys in the Set up search window to modify your search request, allowing you to locate the exact information you need.
The Set up search window displays the special characters you can use to modify your search request.
To change either of these characters (for example, if you want to search for a word that contains an asterisk), type over the character in the Set up search window with the character of your choice and enter your search request.
See "Using Profiles" in topic 13.9 for information on including the SET command in your user profile.

Topic 5.7 at the top of the list contains the best information about this search.
You go to the first occurrence of the search word in the selected topic.
To remove the text lines, press F.
Select Go to next match in the Search pull-down.
You move to the exact location of the next search match in the book, which may or may not be in the same topic.
Select Go to next best topic in the Search pull-down.
If you select Go to next best topic again, you move to the first search match in topic 2.2, not to the next search match in topic.
Location How important a search match is depends on which part of the book it is in.
To move backward one full panel, press F.
To move information on the panel backward several lines, move the cursor to the line that you want to view at the bottom of the panel and press F.
This topic shows you how to go to a particular topic in a book you are currently viewing.
You move to the start of that topic.
You cannot move to a topic by selecting the topic title.
This topic shows you how to go directly to the table of contents, index, figure list, and table list in a book you are currently viewing.
Press F7 or F8 to move backward or forward to see the entire table of contents.
The index is similar to the index in a printed book, except the entries are followed by topic identifiers instead of page numbers.
The status line shows the first and last index entries on the panel instead of line numbers.
Example of an Index You always go to the start of the index.
If the index does not fit on one panel, press F7 or F8 to move backward and forward through the index entries.
You move to the start of the entries that begin with the letter you typed.
Press F7 or F8 to move backward or forward to the entire figure list.
This action moves you to the start of the topic containing the selected figure, not to the start of the figure itself.
Example of a Table List: if the table list does not fit on one panel, you see the section of it that includes the topic you were looking at when you moved to the list of tables.
Press F7 or F8 to move backward or forward to see the entire table list.
You may want to read only the parts of a book that were changed or added since the book was originally produced.
Before closing a book, you may want to view certain topics again.
(You cannot use the Tab key to select words in this way.)
If a link exists to a particular part of another book, such as a topic, figure, or table, you go to the exact location of that item in the other book.
You must then select the one you want to go to.
This example shows what you would see if you linked to topic 1.0 in the book named ELU04INS.
Figure 51 in topic 9.0 shows the Services pull-down.
You can also choose to copy any notes written in a topic, or copy a topic only if it has notes.
If a file of that name already exists, each topic you copy is added to the end of it.
The type of output produced when you copy a topic is chosen originally by your site.
You can change the output type by making selections in the Options pull-down.
See "Choosing Copy Options" in topic 13.6 for details.
You can also use the COPY command to copy topics.
See "COPY - Copying Topics" in topic A.3.8 for examples of using this command.
Select Copy in the Services pull-down.
You see a window in which you must specify whether you want to copy only the topic, the topic and any associated notes, or the topic only if the topic has notes.
Figure 52 in topic 9.1 is an example of the Copy topic window.
The notes in all active note files are copied, not just the notes in your note file.
When you select an action in the Copy topic window, you see another window in which you must specify whether you want to copy the current topic, another topic, or a range of topics.
To copy a single topic:
When the next window appears, you see the identifier of the currently displayed topic in the From topic area.
For example, type 6.2 to copy from the topic specified in From topic up to and including topic.
Begin with a specific topic and copy for a certain number of topics.
To do this, type the number of topics you want to copy in the Number of topics to copy area.
For example, type 3 to copy the topic specified in From topic and the next two topics that follow.
Example of Copying Several Topics While looking at a book online, you can print the current topic or a range of topics on your local printer.
You can also choose to print any notes written in a topic, or print a topic only if it has notes.
The type of output produced, and the command used to direct the output, are chosen originally by your site.
You can change the output type, print device type, and print command by making selections in the Options pull-down.
You can also press F14 to print the current topic, or use the PRINT command to print one or several topics, with or without notes.
See "PRINT - Printing Topics" in topic A.3.23 for examples of using this command.
Topic and notes prints the topic and any notes written in that topic.
Only the topics with notes prints the topic only if any notes were written in that topic.
For example, type 12.0 to print from the topic specified in From topic up to and including topic.
To do this, type the number of topics you want to print in the Number of topics to print area.
You can change the editor and file access types by making selections in the Options pull-down.
See "Choosing Edit Options" in topic 13.8 for information on changing the editor and file access types.
You can view a list of the places you saved in an online book and select the ones you want to go back to.

Notes can exist for an entire topic or for a specific line of text.
To work with a topic note, use the Notes pull-down, shown in Figure 59 in topic.
"Sending Notes to Other Users" in topic 11.6 shows how to share your notes with other users.
"Using Notes from Other Users" in topic 11.7 shows how to view notes written by other users, including how to merge the notes from several users into a single note file.
If a topic has a note, the word Note appears in the status line at the top of the panel.
If a topic has both topic notes and line notes, the status line indicates that a line note exists.
The word Note is not displayed.
If a note already exists, you see its contents in the window.
Otherwise, a message indicates that you are creating a note.
Figure 60 in topic 11.2 is an example of the Note window with a topic note.
Note Window with a Topic Note Table 1 lists the function keys you can use in the Note window to work with notes in a book.
The filename of the note file matches the name of the book you are displaying.
If more than one book of the same name is available, your notes will display in all of them.
The following topics show you how to create notes for entire topics or for specific lines of text in a topic, and how to add the same text to all the notes in a book.
You do not have to be at the start of the topic to add a topic note; you can work with topic notes from any panel displaying that topic.
Press F3 to save the note and remove the Note window.
You create a line note differently from a topic note.
For a line note, you must position the cursor at the line where you want to add a note.
To associate a note with a particular line of text in a topic:
If you want all the notes in a book to have some common information, you can add text automatically to each note you write in that book.
This topic shows you how to display and make changes to existing notes in a book.
When changing a note, do not make changes to the note file on your A-disk.
If you edit a note while you are looking at notes from another user, you make changes to that user's note file on your A-disk.
If you intend to share your notes with other users, make sure you are working with your own note file before making changes to notes in a book.
You do not have to be at the start of the topic to display or change a topic note; you can work with topic notes from any panel displaying that topic.
Press F3 to save the changed note and remove the Note window.
You display and edit a line note differently from a topic note.
For a line note, you must position the cursor at the line in the text where the character is displayed.
To display or edit a note associated with a particular line of text in a topic:
To use the system editor, press F6 while the Note window is displayed.
This allows you to copy notes into the source file as you look at the book online.
When you file the note after editing it, you return to the topic you were viewing.
The note is displayed in the Note window the way you typed it with the editor.
If you are using a split screen to edit the source file and the note, you must exit both screens to return to the online book.
This topic shows you how to delete topic notes and line notes in a book.
To share your notes with other users, you must send your note file to them.
An active note file is one that you added, or selected to view, from those available for viewing.
Use the function keys in this window to add, remove, or merge the note files available to you.
Open the Note window to display the notes.
The first note file you make active becomes the current note file in the book.
When you finish viewing those notes and move on to the next user's notes, the second note file becomes the current note file (and so on).
To switch to the next user's note file, press F2 in the Note window.
The next note file you asked to see becomes the current note file.
When you no longer want to view notes written by another user, you must remove them from the book by making them inactive.
This is useful, for example, when you want to go through a book looking at only the notes written by other users.
Press F2 to see a note that another user has created for that topic.
A message tells you when there are no more notes to review in the book, or that no other user has a note for that topic.

Applications send messages to MSMQ , and MSMQ uses queues of messages to ensure that the messages eventually reach their destination .
Applications that provide network features reside at this layer and access underlying communication protocols .
Applications that run at the highest level of the protocol stack are not really involved in communications , but they do use communication services and so have appropriate features and user interfaces that take advantage of the underlying network .
Applications using the LU 6.2 protocols are called TPs ( transaction programs ) .
APPN ( Advanced Peer - to - Peer Networking ) : The underlying network communication and routing protocol that supports program - to - program communications .
APPN ( discussed next ) adds networking protocol support .
APPN is based on the concept that computers on the network have enough processing power of their own to handle session management and routing .
APPN is basically linklayer independent .
APPN is compared to OSI and TCP / IP in Figure A6 .
APPN moves various services from central control ( such as that provided by a host mainframe computer ) to decentralized control points that operate in a peer to peer relationship .

Bandwidth on demand is a data communication technique for providing additional capacity on a link as necessary to accommodate bursts in data traffic , a videoconference , or other special requirements .
Bandwidth on demand is both economical and practical , it makes sense to use a switched line and only pay for services as they are needed , rather than lease an expensive dedicated line that may go underused part of the time .
Bandwidth reservation can provide a guaranteed level of service , however , governing the bandwidth can be a problem .
Bandwidth reservation is a builtin feature of cellbased ATM networks .
Bandwidth reservation is a way of reserving bandwidth on a channel for special transmissions , usually time sensitive transmissions such as realtime voice and videoconferencing .
Bandwidth reservation is also described as quality of service ( QoS ) or prioritization .

Data is written evenly across the drives by using a technique called striping .
Data is written to both systems simultaneously , and they are interconnected with fast data links to ensure synchronization .
Data link level addresses , which are typically the hardwired addresses on NICs ( network interface cards ) only work on the local LAN .
Data link protocols directly control physical layer communication .
Data links are handled by the SDLC ( Synchronous Data Link Control ) protocol , the BISYNC ( Binary Synchronous Communications ) protocol , Token Ring , and more recently , Ethernet , Frame Relay , and FDDI ( Fiber Distributed Data Interface ) .
Data management includes these areas :
Data management is concerned with the distribution of data to users and the protection of that data from loss such as fire , theft , or unauthorized access .
Data mart or staging systems : This is the place where selected data from back - end systems is stored for access by clients .
Data may be replicated by directories , by database , or by replicating an entire server .
Data migration is an archiving process that moves little - used or unused files to a secondary storage system , such as magnetic tape or optical disk .
Data moves directly into memory , then to an output port , so a backplane bus is not required .
Data must be synchronized between the client and server to ensure consistency .
Data packets arrive from the customer 's network at the FRAD .
Data processing and transmission systems use a variety of techniques to detect and correct errors that occur , usually for any of the following reasons :
Data providers access data from native stores such as DBMSs , spreadsheets , and flat files .
Data rate is related to higher frequency ranges .
Data rate or capacity is a better way to refer to the amount of data that can pass through a system .
Data rates are typically in the range of 2 Mbits / sec , but newer products operate in the 10 - Mbit / sec range .
Data sources include everything from Oracle relational databases to Microsoft Excel spreadsheet data files .
Data streams constitute the whiteboard sessions and control information .
Data striping can occur at the bit level or sector level .
Data that must be available at all sites can be replicated to those sites from a master site .

Database middleware products are designed to provide a middle layer of software that hides the differences among databases .
Database replication and data warehousing in the client / server environment .
Database servers and Web servers are centrally located , rather than departmentally located , so the majority of network traffic flows to the same place .
Database systems have traditionally been tied to a specific front - end interface that did not work with just any client - side application .
Database vendors have introduced so - called universal databases to deal with this .

Fixed - size cells can be switched at very high speed .
Flat - file databases are usually inadequate for business applications .
Flat address space : Windows NT accesses all of a system 's memory as a linear block of memory , rather than the segmented memory architecture that was common in previous operating systems .
Flow - control mechanisms are designed to control the flow of data between sender and receiver so that the receiver 's buffers do not overflow .
Flow control : A technique that prevents the sender from sending more information than the receiver can handle at any one time .
Flow control is the major feature that was added .
Flow control provides a way for two systems to actively cooperate in the transmission of data to prevent overflows and lost datagrams caused by fast senders .
Flow controls are available in ATM in the form of ABR ( available bit rate ) class of service , but they only work if ATM is running all the way to the sender 's desktop .
Flow controls are necessary because senders and receivers are often unmatched in capacity and processing power .
Flow controls are used in the data link layer to control flow on point - to - point links and in the transport layer to control end - to - end flow on a routed network .
Flows are identified based on field information in IP , TCP , and UDP headers .

Kerberos , which is discussed elsewhere in this book , is a security server system that provides a software - based token and one - time password authentication scheme .
Kerberos : This is an advanced authentication system that allows network applications to verify the identity of clients ( and other peer servers ) by using a third - party security server , authenticating the user upon first logon , and then providing other servers with verification that users are who they claim to be .
Kerberos is available for public use and is documented in Internet RFC 1510 .
Kerberos is security system developed at MIT for verifying the identities of users and devices in client / server network environments .
Kerberos is usually called a trusted third - party authentication protocol , meaning that it runs in a computer that is separate from any client or server .
Kerberos provides security for remote logons and can provide a single logon solution so users do not need to log on every time they access a new server .
Kerberos was created by MIT 's Project Athena , a test project for enterprise - wide computing that took place in the late 1980s .
Kernel refers to the core components of most operating systems .
Key capabilities enabled by the Zero Administration for Windows initiative are as follows :

LAN Distance and Size Limitations .
LAN emulation is a method of emulating the characteristics of a LAN over a switched network backbone such as ATM ( Asynchronous Transfer Mode ) .
LAN Emulation services consist of the following three services , which are normally implemented within an ATM switch on the backbone network , although they might also be implemented in a special stand - alone device .
LAN segments attach to the backbone , along with minicomputers , mainframes , and other systems .
LAN segments that typically transmit large files .
LAN Server is based on the LAN Manager server operating system developed jointly with Microsoft .
LAN topologies consist of the designs pictured in Figure T - 13 and described here :

LANE ( LAN Emulation ) : This specification was standardized by the ATM Forum in 1995 to address ways of connecting legacy LANs such as Ethernet and token ring to an ATM backbone network .
LANE ( LAN Emulation ) or MPOA ( Multiprotocol over ATM ) , discussed elsewhere in this book , provide better routing between subnets .
LANE basically creates a bridged network across the ATM network .
LANE consists of the legacy workstations and LECs described above , as well as LAN Emulation services .
LANE defined individual VLANs while MPOA provides for routing between those VLANs .
LANE defines a scheme for encapsulating higher - level protocol datagrams into ATM cells and delivering them across the ATM backbone as if the backbone were a LAN .
LANE does not provide a total solution for getting end to endATM connectivity .
LANE emulates a LAN across the ATM network .
LANE is an ATM ( Asynchronous Transfer Mode ) specification that was standardized by the ATM Forum ( http : / / www . atmforum . com ) in 1995 to address ways of connecting legacy LANs such as Ethernet and token ring to an ATM backbone network .

LAPD is the protocol used on ISDN ( Integrated Services Digital Network ) 's D channel .
LAPD works across the D channel to provide control and signaling information .
LAPF ( LAP for Frame - Mode Bearer Services ) provides the data link for frame relay networks .
LAPF is designed for use with frame relay .
LAPs similar to those operated by CRL Network Services are designed to avoid the problems of packets needing to travel outside of a metropolitan ( or regional ) area to a NAP , MAE , or other switching center , and then back into the same metropolitan area to reach their destination .
Large corporations may have individual POP servers for each department or division .
Large internetworks typically have many different paths that packets can take to reach a destination .
Large networks with many LAN segments and heavy traffic produced by high - performance workstations , graphics file transfers , or other internetwork traffic will benefit from FDDI .
Large server systems can offload applications that are better handled by personal workstations .
Large transmissions are divided into packets instead of being transmitted as one long string .
Lasers are used to generate the light signal for single - mode cable .
LATAs were defined during the restructuring of AT &amp; T in 1984 , and there are close to 200 of them .
LATAs were defined during the split - up of AT &amp; T . The border of a LATA defines where local service ends and long - distance service begins .
Latency is another thing to consider .
Latency refers to the gap from when the words are spoken to when the listener can hear the words .
Later , when it can resume receiving data , it can send a segment with this field set to a nonzero value and an appropriate value in the Acknowledgment Number field to indicate which segment it needs .
Later , HTTP 1.0 was defined in RFC 1945 .
Later , the CCITT ( now referred to as the ITU ) modified HDLC for use in its X.25 packet - switching network standard .

RMON is an IETF network monitoring and analysis standard similar to SNMP ( Simple Network Management Protocol ) that was developed to overcome some of the limitations of SNMP .
RMs are typically tied to relational databases .
Rotation speed : This is the speed at which the disk platters spin .
Route attributes such as the cost or security of a path are also added .
Route servers are routers or embedded functions in ATM switches that calculate routes in the network .
Route servers provide routing information to ISPs and a boost in throughput that allows ISPs to deliver their customers 'data more efficiently through the Internet .
Route servers support routing protocols like RIP ( Routing Information Protocol ) and OSPF ( Open Shortest Path First ) so they can communicate routing information to other route servers and traditional routers .
Router - connected networks are more secure in this respect because they separate networks into individual broadcast domains that contain traffic and can be used to control traffic that passes beyond the routers .
Router A then forwards the packet to router B or F , depending on a number of conditions , such as the current network load or predefined rules .
Router AB then forwards packets to Router BC .
Router B or F forwards the packet to router C or E , which in turn forwards the packet to D .
Router manufacturers must RSVP - enable their routers .
Routers ( originally called gateways ) provided this encapsulation service .
Routers : Provide a way to connect multiple LANs together to create internetworks .
Routers allow each interconnected network to retain its subnetwork address , broadcast characteristics , and so on , but each network can still communicate through the router connections with other networks .
Routers along the circuit don't need to make routing decisions because the direction of flow has already been established .
Routers along the way may make routing decisions about the path a datagram should take to reach its destination , based on traffic conditions or downed lines .
Routers are also an essential part of the WAN interconnection .
Routers are interested in the network address , so they reverse the process to extract the network portion of the IP address .
Routers are internetworking devices .
Routers are often used in conjunction with gateways to build a multitiered defense system , although many commercial firewall products may provide all the functionality you need .
Routers are required to move packets from one ELAN to another , but routers are notoriously slow .
Routers are responsible for determining the next hop that will get a packet to its destination , not the complete path to the destination .
Routers are still needed to transmit packets among different VLANs .
Routers are the switches that direct packets over one path or another based on stored information that indicates the best path to a destination .
Routers are used to interconnect the different networks and encapsulate the packets .
Routers check this server before reserving bandwidth .
Routers connect each of the existing networks into this backbone .
Routers examine the IP address and determine the port on which to forward the packet .
Routers exchange BACP messages to negotiate link requirements for providing extra bandwidth or to take lines down when extra bandwidth is no longer needed .
Routers exchange information about paths with one another and put this information in tables .
Routers in this scheme must be multicast enabled .
Routers inform other routers of their cost assignments , and these neighboring routers add up the costs to come up with a figure that is used to determine the most efficient route through a network .
Routers join the autonomous networks of the Internet .
Routers may also be programmed with routes by administrators .
Routers may also connect two LANs within an organization .
Routers move packets among networks as necessary .
Routers must be multicast enabled to use this feature .
Routers obtain information about the router from other routers and then build extensive tables that define the best way to route packets .
Routers on connectionless networks do not keep complete information about how to reach all possible destinations on the network .
Routers on the network must be multicast - enabled to take advantage of these features .
Routers only forward frames that are specifically addressed to devices on other networks .
Routers periodically broadcast packets to neighboring routers that contain the most current routing table information .
Routers provide the following important services :
Routers provide the traffic control that delivers packets to the right destination .
Routers run routing protocols to discover neighboring routers and the networks attached to them .
Routers running NLSP exchange information about network links , the cost of paths , ipx network numbers , and media types .
Routers set up multicasting among themselves , but a router only does multicasting if some host on its attached network has requested to be a member of a multicast group .
Routers store the information in tables and then look it up to determine an optimal path through the network for packets .
Routers then forward the packets to the appropriate network .
Routers then learn these addresses .
Routers use protocols to communicate with other routers to obtain information about the topology of the network .
Routers use routing protocols and algorithms to dynamically map the network topology and share that information with one another .
Routers with no group members return a " prune " message , which essentially prevents further multicast messages for that group from reaching the router .
Routers within an autonomous system are called interior routers , and routers that interconnect autonomous systems are called exterior routers .
Routers without any need to be part of a particular multicast do not get involved , in order to avoid unnecessary traffic .
Routes can be based on the avoidance of congested areas , the speed of a line , the cost of using a line , or various priorities .
Routes can be based on the avoidance of congested areas , the speed of a line , the cost of using a line , or various priorities .
Routing allows administrators to put security policies in place as well , such as packet - filtering techniques as discussed under " Firewall . " .
Routing Arbiter The Routing Arbiter provides master routing tables for all the routers connected to the NAPs and other Internet exchanges , thus eliminating the need for routers to exchange routing information with every other router .
Routing becomes a bottleneck and virtual circuits that provide QoS ( quality of service ) between two nodes are not possible .
Routing decisions are based on the least number of " hops " to a destination .
Routing information is exchanged among routers approximately every 30 seconds .
Routing information is organized so each routing device only needs to keep enough information to guide packets to the next most important router .
Routing is an activity that takes place in the network layer ( layer 3 ) relative to the OSI protocol stack .
Routing is an essential component in a VLAN environment .
Routing is disabled between the network interface cards in the dual - homed system so that the application - level software can control how traffic is handled between networks .
Routing is necessary with VLANs to contain broadcasts and add security .
Routing is required to send packets on internetworks that consist of separate subnetworks .
Routing protocols are used between routers as a way to update routers about the current state of the network .
Routing protocols provide the all - important mechanism of finding the most efficient path through a network .
Routing protocols were developed to handle the creation of routing tables .
Routing services are performed in a single MPOA routing server , so edge devices do not need to include the circuitry or software to perform those services ; however some argue that routing in edge devices is more efficient .
Routing switch : A routing switch is a new class of router that uses specially designed ASICs ( application - specific integrated circuits ) that can perform routing at multigigabit speeds .
Routing tables are created as normal .
Routing tables include network numbers , port numbers , cost metrics , and the address of the next hop .

RPCs are tools for creating client / server applications that can run procedures on other computers attached to a network .
RPCs first appeared on Sun Microsystems and Hewlett - Packard computers running under the UNIX operating system .
RPCs get around this problem by tagging calls with a description of the calling machine 's basic data representation .
RPCs let clients interact with multiple servers and allow servers to handle multiple clients simultaneously .
RPCs provide connection - oriented links between applications in client / server environments , while MOM is generally connectionless .
RPCs provide the communication mechanism for a client to communicate its requests for service to a back - end server .

TCP / IP networks have proliferated in many organizations .
TCP / IP overlays existing LANs and their MAC addressing scheme with an internetwork addressing scheme that lets a user on one segment of the internetwork send messages to users on any other segment .
TCP / IP protocol packets are encapsulated inside the PPP frames and transported across the link .
TCP / IP provides fragmentation at routers , which can solve the problem of differences between frame sizes on two different networks .
TCP / IP was also made to run on PCs and other small computers .
TCP adds its own header information in the transport layer to form a packet called a segment .
TCP and SPX are transport layer protocols .
TCP can negotiate this value by measuring the time it takes to receive responses .

TCP in turn uses IP to deliver information across a network .
TCP is a transport layer component of the Internet 's TCP / IP protocol suite .
TCP is described in IETF RFC 793 .
TCP manages this by starting with a simple connection request , which IP delivers .
TCP may have to deal with a number of connection parameters during the connection setup phase .
